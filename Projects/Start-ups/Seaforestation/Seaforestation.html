<p> I was switching gears career wise. I had a long history in hospitality and wine education. I was a sommelier, taught classes and I had my own wine bar. I sold the wine bar a few years ago, took a break, did some travelling, did some coral reef restoration work, started a family and then decided that I wanted to get back to work.  I thought about winemaking for a little while. But then I realised that the world needed more people to work on climate, and not another winemaker. So I started thinking about what avenues would be of interest to me and I've always been passionate about the ocean - I'm a dive master, one of the most fun jobs I ever had was doing the coral reef restoration work in Thailand. And so I started looking at some possible ocean avenues and solutions and seaweed kept coming up. And so as I was trying to educate myself about seaweed, what I noticed was that there was no kind of centralised location to aggregate the available information about seaweed. And so that was really kind of the impetus for putting this website together. I wanted it to be a place where you know, if you knew nothing about seaweed, you would find something, if you knew something, you would still find something. And if you do a lot, you could still find something interesting. So, you know, it's still very much a work in progress- It's a young site, we just started building it in in January and still working out some kinks. But, you know,  I think, for me, it started out that education was the most important aspect. But now I've kind of switched gears a little bit and in the thinking that the news is kind of the more important aspects I'm so I've been working on setting up these RSS feeds to capture like the seaweed news as it happens. Because I think, you know, as you mentioned, it keeps coming up, right, seaweed is starting to have its moment Finally, and I wanted to be able to capture that on the website.

What's been some of the biggest challenges you've encountered, building this?

There's been big learning curve on the technical aspect of building the site. Then there's the issue with getting through a lot of noise to do with seaweed. So finding, you know, articles or videos or podcasts that are actually like decent and you can learn something from them, as you know, can be a challenge. It takes time to find the level of resources that I wanted for the website. In order to get around this, just trying to break the seaweed down into bite sized chunks is important. That way, if someone's only interested in one of those topics they don't have to scroll through a million articles to find what you're looking for. So I think that's part of it. And just having like, very plain spoken language, no, not referring to it as macro algae and just having some fun facts sprinkled in there, just, you know, really trying to keep it very approachable.

What's your perspective on where the industry is going?

Unknown Speaker  10:11  
It's a really exciting time for for seaweed. There's a lot of capital being invested in projects related to seaweed. I've been particularly interested in using seaweed as a cattle feed additive to try to reduce methane- I was doing a climate sprint recently and we as a team were just really impressed with the all the potential benefits that come with growing seaweed. There are other challenges, for example scaling might be an issue for production and there will need to be a significant increase in communication in the space to connect the moving parts.




    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    So my role coming into the company was formulation scientist or senior scientist, which is. Oh, yeah. So so the role of that is to say I'll get given a drug either because of a grant or a company wants me to formulate a specific drug. I'm always just interested in this drug company. And then I mix this drug into different excipients is the technical term, but just different materials. Exactly. Chemicals to create a formulation like a cartridge or filament, FDM three printing and then you reprint it. So and then I have to test as well to make sure that the drug is still active after 3D printing. So basically making 3D printable formulations of drugs already on the market. But then I also do other things because it's not many people. I'm also like the designated PR person designated. Right.

<p> I was quite keen on working in a startup. So large companies in so many words scared me like just a tiny cog in this massive machine. You don't get I mean, I'm not that ever worked in a massive corporation. Be worried about not being so nice, being like I am. Celui actually describes in his field he describes as being a code monkey. Yes. I mean, just like when I say like it mindstate people like it, just like a lab monkey, just like blindly passing. I'm not really thinking because he was looking for you and I don't really want to do that on a startup as well. You get you get involved in a company way more. Like I said, I've got multiple roles and I really like that. Yeah, that's basically it. 
    
In the simulation side I, I'm working on this project for this grant that we got on our news web page. Gustaaf received. Okay. Projects that we're working on. That's my main product until at the end of the year. And then we're continuously looking for new opportunities like corporations and grants. So we're going to be yeah, basically we're I can't say specifics. Yeah. We're we're looking into applying for more and more corporations. The printer itself was looking well. I mean, it's again, I probably can't say much. That's not really my side of things when my boss who works on that sort  </p>

<p>It was it was partly I like to pop it was applied to everything and I got out. So I did that. Yeah. Wow. Because the next day just to my sleep, so I got a it was a grant to. My project and a lot of training to lectures basically and seminars on business and law and that sort of stuff. It was it was good. I managed to say my project. I organized another animal trials on the shelves I produced in my Ph.D. with my team. So like me, my supervisors. So the guy who worked on the project for my team and the the animal trials happening this summer, actually. So now they'll be writing up the project now because the ground was so large and no one was quite as large as me, it wasn't large, but because there was no one works on it full time and I only had six months with a salary on this program, we had to outsource the project. So we got the other company to do tests due to the experiments and write the project up for us. So I should get back. Yeah. </p>

<p>Was that the reason you wanted to stray away from the academic world. You said you wanted all he wanted to work in startups, but you are turning your back on the advance academic levels?</p>

<p>I did enjoy academia like well while I was there. But my main dislike of academia is that it's driven by publishing papers like churning papers out. And these papers don't end up don't necessarily end up doing anything. They might be revolutionary, but then half the time, like a large percentage of the time, no one commercializes them, which means they don't end up in place. And it's all about business. You know, you can't get the drug onto the market, that business. And that's one of the reasons why we like to start off in academia. And then they did something with it. They did something with that research and they got the startup, which is building a lot of academics just to sell my research, publish it. And then I settled into the next project,

<p>you had a short internship with Knopfler, so you've had some exposure to more than most to the climate tech biomaterial space. Right. I'm sure you've done some reading and plenty reading and research in this area, but I wanted to get your opinion, if you have one on on the use of seewhy using material for well, not only for as a material, as an industry. Do you have any opinions on where the seaweed industry seems to be going? </p>

<p>I think it's it is a useful product. It will produce useful products. But I think there are a lot of not not necessarily not just from my reading, my experience. There are a lot of projects, unlike materials using seaweed that I don't think will become a thing like a very I think that only is seen as a hype.whether that was get off the ground or not and be successful. Widespread is is questionable. I think there is there is movement that because as well as a you I don't know. Do you think the new EU law says PLA they're going to not going to class that more is plastic rather than a biodegradable material. Wow.

    
    And that's obviously a lot of company. It despite a lot of companies use Publius like a biodegradable material compost and actually it only compost. High temperatures in very specific environment that's on record, it's not mimicking the natural environment at all. Yeah, so that Creighton's all that's going to come in, I don't know what is going to come in, but I not, like, really excited by all because it means that business will be well. Yeah. And but it means that there's the alginate field will probably do because of that

<p>Maybe I'm one of them is I'm getting money. Yeah, like grants and stuff. All I be project is like stumped because you don't have enough money. That's always an issue. Regulation is another issue. Obviously regulation is a good thing. Don't get me wrong for a new field, it's it's like a minefield. Like, you know, logically you should be able to do something. But regulation says no because it's it's such a new field. I mean, like it's like I said, the regulation is extremely important. We need it. But sometimes it can be tricky to like to do to get around. And yeah,
