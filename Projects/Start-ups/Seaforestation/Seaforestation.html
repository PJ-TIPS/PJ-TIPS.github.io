<p> Seaforestatiom is a website helping educate the world on the benefits of seaweed afforestation and cultivation to help reverse climate change and to create healthier ocean ecosystems. The creator is Alexis Kahn.  </p>

<p> I was switching gears career wise. I have a long history in hospitality and wine education as a sommelier, teacher and I had my own wine bar. I sold the wine bar a few years ago, took a break, did some travelling, coral reef restoration, started a family and then decided that I wanted to get back to work.

I thought about winemaking for a little while but then I realised that the world needed more people to work on climate and not another winemaker. 
    
    <br> 
    <br> So, I started thinking about what avenues would be of interest to me. I've always been passionate about the ocean - I'm a dive master and one of the most fun jobs I ever had was doing coral reef restoration work in Thailand. So, I started looking at some possible avenues and solutions and seaweed kept coming up. As I was trying to educate myself about seaweed I noticed that there was no centralised location to aggregate the available information about seaweed. That was the impetus for putting this website together. </p>

    <h1 class="mb-5"><em>"Education was the most important aspect of the industry."</em></h1>  
       </div>   
    
<p> It's still very much a work in progress as it's a young site but, for me, education was the most important aspect of the industry. Now I've switched direction a little towards showcasing the news. 
</p>
                      
                        <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5 text-center">

<p>What's been some of the biggest challenges you've encountered, building Seaforestation?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> There's been a big learning curve on the technical aspect of building the site. Then there's the issue with getting through the noise to get to the useful information. Finding decent articles, videos or podcasts can be a challenge.
    
    <br> 
    <br> 
    It takes time to find the standard that I want for the website. In order to get around this, just trying to break the seaweed down into bite sized chunks is important. That way, if someone's only interested in one of those topics they don't have to scroll through a million articles to find what you're looking for. 
  </p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5 text-center">

<p>What's your perspective on where the industry is going?</p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
<p>It's a really exciting time for for seaweed. There's a lot of capital being invested in projects related to the industry. I've been particularly interested in the use of seaweed as a cattle feed additive to try to reduce methane. I was part of a Climate Sprint recently and our team were really impressed with all the potential benefits that come with growing seaweed and using it for cattle. There are challenges in this space, for example scaling might be an issue for production and there will need to be a significant increase in communication in the space to connect the moving parts. These challenges need to be addressed.
