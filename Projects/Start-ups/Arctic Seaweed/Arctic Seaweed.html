<p>What was the motivation behind creating Arctic Seaweed?
  </p>
      </b>
                                </div>

     <br>
<p>Many things, one being that I always wanted to do something different and I wanted to build something from nothing. Then, four or five years ago I got an opportunity when I met this young entrepreneur with a brilliant idea on these artificial reefs for seabird rehab rehabilitation. And I met him through these very low key miniature Shark Tank. Whether you basically all these actors get to meet people from the industries. And a few weeks after I was asked to mentor him, we have a system in Norway where you can, like, get funding to, to mentor young entrepreneurs. And this led to that we figured out seaweed that is very, very exciting. And some good ideas on how to develop concepts to sort of break out of the traditional horizontal, long line farming into a more industrialised concept and started the company together. took us about four months to raise us. And that we are we are on the brink of expansion. So it's, yeah, you asked about the motivation? So I don't know. It is really motivating to do something meaningful. Yeah. Yeah, can appreciate that.

<p>Where do you see the industry going in the not so distant future?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> My impression is we are approaching the catch up effect. We're breaking through the glass roof because the challenge so far is that we don't produce enough volume to be considered a serious contender in especially in business to business. fast moving consumer goods. We so we need them in order to sort of get delegate rolling on the volume but they are not willing to risk taking out taking out a new ingredient if they can be sure that robust valuation or as a budget. I think we are getting close to the mark where everything is just going to the demand is going to go really is really going to pick up the price of course it's going to drop but that's been expect all along. But we also know that with volumes we get we get lower production costs. But always talk about carbon sequestration and all our i don't know i that's, that's a bit more far fetched. Yeah, I know. But as an ingredient and as a sustainable, locally sourced ingredient. I do believe it's sustainable. We have to fix a few things. We are not they're not there yet. Yeah. There was a lot of work making LCA is now for, for the seaweed industry to find out where are the gaps? What can we do to actually be truly sustainable? We use a lot of it, we still create a lot of waste. We do use energy, we do use fuel, use sometimes significant amounts. So we need to find ways of reducing all our footprints, and inputs. And technology exists. So I think we're going to solve that because the theory itself, it doesn't use as you know, it doesn't use freshwater fertiliser. We only use sunlight, we don't use any empty to grow. So the product itself is fine. But the entire supply chain relevant is past some. some challenges, but I think they're mainly due to the lack of the correct technologies. the interest and the focus in in the news in the media is it's increasing so much. The which is creating a winning Cola, Coca Cola effect from the consumer side, which is motivating companies to look at this ingredient, which is motivating companies to reach out to suppliers. European wants to ask for more.  </p>

<p> How do you monitor the quality and who would you send that to?  </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
<p>Well, you have the technical quality, which is the composition of the plant. So, that means you send a plant or a sample of the plant for analysis. When you look for the different components, you look for the bad things, and you look for the good things. And the most important thing, the bad things like the heavy metals, the the ironing. And because we need to document the the content of that, that is a direct quality issue to have the microbiologic. So we also send samples for microbiology analysis, again, to document that we don't have any pathogens, you know, basically just a green light. And then you have the, then you have then sort of the.so we call it quantifiable quality, which is the flat size. Basically, the the visual class, this show extra feeling you get when you look at it, that's that's one factor or not, can't really be it's not quantifiable. We don't have a scale saying, Okay, if it's this colour, it's it's quality. My phone. And then we have the most important factor for us if we want to do it right as food is falling. So we have to harvest our seaweed before it is found with external organisms like and bryozoans and other grazers. Right? Yes. So it's basically three factors. Two of them, two of them are very easy to determine one, you central monitor the other one, you can actually see if we have falling on it. Okay, that's quality B. Right.  </p>

<p>make sure you have enough funding and long term. industrials. Yep. Because it's going to take more time than you believe. Okay. You start is to approximate is going to take more time and more money than you think. What else? Make sure you're you're in it for the long run. Yeah. Same thing, not not just funding but yourself. Because it is going to take time it's going to be tough. So, my co co founder, he will be dropped out in 2018 . So there is the you need patience, and drive. You need a good beat. Yeah.
