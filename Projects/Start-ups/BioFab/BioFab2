<p>
My background is in packaging as one of my other companies 
    
I had a background working in packaging. One of my other companies growpack was sort of working in sustainable packaging space was largely like importing products here. 
    
    that was doing things like pla, shopping bags, home compostable stuff, which I remember thinking PLa and biopolymers weren't, you know, the miracle plastic that everyone hoped it wouldn't be. 
    
    
   so that was kind of my background was sort of working in packaging. I'd been working under my old man who did a lot of sort of industrial and engineer type packaging. I wanted to do things my own way but to that when I started, grow pack. 
    
and then before we started biofab, I had a friend that was starting up a hemp company in New Zealand called hemp New Zealand and I invested a small amount of money in that. Then it was when I started learning about hemp and in particularly industrial hemp that I was really that wehere my unique interest started. 
    
And I sort of took the the motto of Well, hopefully we learned to eat healthy enough one day where we need less medicines, you know, natural or pharmaceutical. But once we learn how to make shit in a truly sustainable way, there's no going back. 
    
about six months after the I made that investment into the hemp company, aI felt sure an opportunity would pop up around hemp. I was sitting watching a guy called Andreas Mershon, who is he's one of our scientific advisors. Now. He's got his own lab at MIT in the states and he was down in New Zealand talking about a range of the technology he was working on. And mycellium was one of them. So they had like some grant money, you know, from NASA, where they were looking how to grow homes on Mars. What was really cool that they were looking at developing semi temporary semi permanent housing in Afirca using these materials Allowing for fast or rapid migration of  population and people and developing areas, it means that, you know, whatever they leave behind could, you know, integrate back with the natural environment. 
    
They were growing mushrooms that they could then dry and sell on an national market. So it was giving these developing areas, something to trade, and then the waste from producing the mushrooms they would use to grow the building. So I was fascinated. and at the end of that He said hemp was one of the best growing substrates. There I was thinking I know, who is now the largest hemp processor in the country. I'm connected with him, I'm looking for things to do with the raw material. And so that that was that sort of first point of interest that caused me to hang around after that, after that presentation. That's where I met one of the co founders. And then from there, it was really, this guy Andreas was like, you know, hey, if you're really interested in this, and you got a background in packaging, you got a background in hemp, you know, why don't why not look at this as an opportunity. So we we spent a month or so looking around New Zealand to where this technology was being worked with. And there was a couple of things that we found in universities. And then this is when the sky Andreas had mentioned this company ecovative in the States, so he was also working with them. So I had literally just use the power of LinkedIn premium, reached out to one of the co founders of incubators, kind of gave him the 32nd elevator message pitch as to why I love the technology and wanted to work with it. And then, you know, I look back now and it was literally that simple, but I feel very lucky, there must have been a little bit of timing and a little bit of luck, and probably something out there looking over that was like, um, you know, that sort of created that opportunity. 
    
then we were pretty early on, we were faced with the issue of like, love what he provided with doing amazing technology. And I was like, I really want to work with it. But we couldn't import the fungal species they were working with, because of biosecurity laws to New Zealand and Australia. But then it became and as become one of the core foundation to our business was that we had to develop our own fungal species. And it's really allowed us to like, you know, the, these this side of by fair, where we're going to market with this mycelium package. And now we're working with ecovative and using their technology, but we've had to do it with the by developing our own fungal species in extend the research that we're now doing into, you know, what are the other cool things that fungi can do? 
    
I'm really glad that biosecurity rules because it's put us in a really unique position, where even with ecovative, like we're the only partners of them globally that are working with the entire supply chain. 
    

    
What does the partnership with Ecovative look like?
  
So, we just have, they essentially licenced us some of the technology. We are out there using our own fungal species to utilise it. And then we you know, that they get the kickback through a royalty payment.  it's a, it feels pretty special to be part of like, you know, a group of people you know, that are plugged in globally that are working with mycelium and fungi. And now that it really enables us to do this, you know, all this research into and, and mycology which now I'm a big believer that there's a, there's a tonne of amazing innovation to come out of it. if there's any example of intelligent nature, I used to say, you know, look at the hemp plant, because it's got so many uses, and even now I'm like, Look at, look at my cilium look at Fang guy, and it is a, it's, I feel really fortunate that I've got like a career that I can see lasting for the next 100 years, you know, in front of me working in that space.

Have you run into any challenges from a regulatory stand-point and where do you see hemp and mycellium going over the next five years? 

Unknown Speaker  16:58  
well, first producing the mycelium at scale, the spawn like that, that problem was already solved through the commercial mushroom growing industries. TUsing hemp is ideal, but it's not the only raw material we can use. So the industry is growing and hopefully will grow at a rate that we grow, where we don't run into problems of supply.
 
And even with this material, we've been really lucky because, function wise, it was a direct drop in for polystyrene. So, you know, it's really easy to kind of, you know, just say, Hey, you know, we'll make it in the same shape, and start using it. And we've also found that in many cases,  because we have such low tooling cost. There's lots of applications, where we're actually a cheaper alternative than using things like cardboard inserts but with greater protection value and impact resistance. It's also got really good thermal capabilities, so when you look at replacing polystyrene, you know, I think there's a lot of customers now not as sensitive to 
the fact that they're going to have to pay more for new materials, especially in the beginning. You know, polystyrene wouldn't be as cheap as polystyrene at the starting again today. And especially with all the regulation that's now being, you know, really coming in, there is a it's a, like how I've been working at packaging space for the last like five years in tehre price has always been like a big issue for people as well. But we're finding that a lot less of a barrier, because this material, you know, besides its sustainability profile, it's actually a great material to use, there aren't, there aren't that many sacrifices when it comes to using it compared to polystyrene. If you're a company that has already switched away from polystyrene to cardboard, quite often,  the mycelium composite performs better than what they've switched to. So they're gaining functionality back, which might mean less breakages or greater  protection. And it seems like there's a lot of new startups that have now grown into medium or large sized businesses where they never use polystyrene in the first place. So they're not comparing what they're trying to switch to, to this cheap material. And then that whole perspective and that's what I'm really hopeful about as as we grow as time goes on, is more and more businesses start. 
    
    What;s next for you guys?

Unknown Speaker  20:25  
We are like right at the tail end of our first capital raise to build our first sort of commercial scale plant. We're hoping that that will be sort of done in the next sort of, I'm hoping four to six weeks, and then we really just had to go back and on building this first plant, we've kind of been, it's been really annoying, because we haven't been able to supply people material beyond you know, samples and things like that And a really small number of customers, we're,
    
we're building a whole this demand now, and I'm kind of sitting there being like, you know, until that capital raises done, you know, our start date isn't set in stone. So I'm just really, I can't wait to have this capital raised down. And then we can actually spend that next nine to 12 months, while we're doing that first commercial scale plan actually being like, Hey, you know, now we really need to work with you. Because we're going to be able to deliver product within a known timeframe. But we've been really, really lucky, with ecovative in the states and the magical mushroom company in the UK, who are working with the technology as well. So we are really fortunate that, even though we have a very limited ability to take product to market right now, We're still having customers getting to see this material being used, which is helping us build up that that real demand. Because as you start to see sort of more and more bigger brands using it, You know, customers are like, Okay, well, that's a lot of validation for me if I can see seedlip or if I can see lush, you know, already using the stuff. You know, you know, it's a good when people first hear about my psyllium it sounds like one of these, you know, amazing fantastical materials that probably just got stuck in a test tube and never scaled. And then when people actually see that no, this technology that he's scaling is actually being used and being adopted. It's, it's a, it's a really cool, like, a little a little sort of side note, like one of our, one of our co founders, he's the largest grower of exotic mushrooms in the countries. So that's tiny compared to your baton and portabello producers, you know, the so you're an okie inch attacchi, and things like that. Not those types of exotic mushrooms. But the and the, but I remember when we first saw him, you know, and we told this guy who was far more experienced than us with with all this technology with all the sight the space. And we were telling him how quickly we can grow this material room when we first saw him, he was almost like navfac off, like that's not, you know, awesome cap
we were like we were showing videos, and he was like, oh, wow, like I'm so you know, even people that have worked in the industry for decades, you know, have thought that this sounds impossible. But it's really cool. When you bet. Yeah, so I guess what, what's next is just having that plan built out of supply people?

How have you been finding new buyers- is that a problem?  
Like, sort of yes or no, or like this might be unseen. Yep. So because we've been purposely like throttling or not, until very recently, really pushing ourselves out there. There's no we were still getting lots of demand because ecovative people talk to ecovative in Australia or New Zealand, or in that sort of a region, they will get pushed to us. So that was like, we were sort of building demand through that way. We We We went out to a couple of really big potential customers that we started working with sort of earlier, but they had that they're fine with expectations of this takes a long time. And we've seen like, like we're really sort of upskilling some of the other team members to help me with sales and stuff. It's been good because we've really been throttling it until very recently, because we didn't want to reach out to potential customers, build up all this hype, and then tell them that you've actually got to wait two or three years, until it's ready. We are now we're we're sort of that nine to 12 months out, out, now is that appropriate time to really start trying to gain reach out there. So we're starting it, and it's, it's coming in as we put more out there,
 
but,  you know, obviously, we want to keep growing it. So it hasn't felt like a problem yet. But you know, there's one that we want that interest to keep growing and growing. 
    
    
How do you guys tackle decision making as a team- especially because it sounds like youre operating under a fair amount of uncertainty?
    
    even from a pretty early stage had a governance board set up with one very senior experience person that isn't a co founder on that. So, you know, we we have meetings with them, you know, anywhere from one to three times a week. We've got ecovative, I, we have a direct line to ecovative and the other partners through slack. So we just hit we ever have like a problem or a question. Like, we've got great, a great community out there, both internally and externally, that we can get questions asked for. We've got a great team, like, you know, we've got a team where we, you know, we have we have meaningful conversations or viewpoints that are quite often different. But we've never got into an argument about anything. And like, we always come to, you know, what feels like the right decision. 
    
    It's lucky when you're in startup stage, and you're not going to market that's where you got lots of times, like, you know, we've done 100 edits after our final edit of our business plan. bus It's big, beyond what we thought was the final edit of our of our business plan and our aim, and you talk to invest, learn, and you update so but that we're really, really lucky when it comes to the actual manufacturing side of the business. So you know, we've got ecovative, who's done this before. So, you know, we've got that ability to read and learn from someone who's had lots of mistakes, and hopefully minimises the amount we make. But, but yeah, we've got a really strong network of a decent size team for a start up, we've got advisors, we've got ecovative and the investors that we're trying to bring on, you know, they bring a lot more than just the money as well. So it kind of feels like every time that we need to take a step up and growth, you know, the people or whoever is needed for that sort of come into play. So there's been, yeah. 
    
    
    WHat advice might you give to your younger self or someone else starting out on this journey?
    Well, the first bit of advice that I always give in, given that I've had previous businesses, is to just start. Not in a reckless way, but making that decision to really commit to what you want to do. There's so many people that have great ideas... I always had ideas, but I came to realise I was an expert, and sort of, you know, thinking what I needed to do to run a business from the point of where it was actually already set up. And then when I said I'd never start anything, and I'd sit there and be like, you know, ah, I don't know why this is happening, then when I came to realise quite often just taking that first step is, is normally free to do or it's very cheap, and start building momentum. So that's a little bit more sort of a broad first answer, but that's the biggest thing is actually, you know, plan Yes, like give that time to think about how you want to do things. But also, you know, remember that nothing is perfect, plans always change and the only way you're going to navigate your way through actually just starting and getting to it, the kind of ideas that are probably set in someone's head and never came to fruition, just because they didn't send that message.  Some people might think, oh, what if I say, I'm silly? What if I say, I'm stupid, what if I get rejected or psych, you know, who cares, it's like, you know, the feeling of rejection, you know, might make you feel silly for five minutes. But the, you know, the regret, of not doing something can last a lifetime. 
    
    So that's, and then I think, other advices, you know, there's always, which I think we've done really well has been, you know, really think about, like, who you're going to go into work with, you know, you're forming a relationship with them. make sure that who you go into work with the people that, you know, I think you can be friends with, you know, because you need, you need to have that because team is everything. 
    
    My advice is that, you know, especially in a startup, you know, team is 51% of the equation, the idea is 49%. And, you know, a great idea can go to ship with a bad team, an average idea can become successful with a great team. And lastly, actively invest a lot of time, energy and money into looking after your brain, your mental health and personal growth. Whether that's meditation, doing courses that are around, you know, my other, you know, sometimes non physical interests. And then you've got to have,  a business that you're passionate about, but you need to have other things in your life, whether that be sport, you know, something that you can take take, you know, because you have these 13 hour days, sometimes, but you got to, and that's fine, that's part of being a startup, and sometimes you're going to be extremely high stress level. So you got to make sure that you actively balance that out. I learned with this business, if I wasn't investing my time and doing my, you know, my meditation practices, breath practices, you know, going on, like many type of, you know, excursions for a few days to get away from work when I when I had that time. And those my capacity, you know, or stress levels would have gone up really high. And then when we had these critical moments in the business that were really stressful, I wouldn't have had that capacity to absorb that stress. And burnout, mental health, you know, your mental state, like, you have to look after that.  you've really got to learn how to, you know, restore your energy.  burnout hurts you, and you are forced to take time off because you might literally go temporarily insane because of the stress levels. You cannot, I can guarantee you you won't be able to control when that comes on. And if you allow that to happen, where you're forced to take time off your playing lotto as to when that time will be and that that's a crucial stage of your business. And you need to take time out. That can that can be something that you know if you can Want to buy, you know, what you might miss out on? If you're if you if that happens, there's probably $1 value to that that can be a make or break or, you know, something in the business. So

<p>We are like right at the tail end of our first capital raise to build our first sort of commercial scale plant. We're hoping that that will be sort of done in the next sort of, I'm hoping four to six weeks, and then we really just had to go back and on building this first plant, we've kind of been, it's been really annoying, because we haven't been able to supply people material beyond you know, samples and things like that And a really small number of customers, we're,
    
we're building a whole this demand now, and I'm kind of sitting there being like, you know, until that capital raises done, you know, our start date isn't set in stone. So I'm just really, I can't wait to have this capital raised down. And then we can actually spend that next nine to 12 months, while we're doing that first commercial scale plan actually being like, Hey, you know, now we really need to work with you. Because we're going to be able to deliver product within a known timeframe. But we've been really, really lucky, with ecovative in the states and the magical mushroom company in the UK, who are working with the technology as well. So we are really fortunate that, even though we have a very limited ability to take product to market right now, We're still having customers getting to see this material being used, which is helping us build up that that real demand. Because as you start to see sort of more and more bigger brands using it, You know, customers are like, Okay, well, that's a lot of validation for me if I can see seedlip or if I can see lush, you know, already using the stuff. You know, you know, it's a good when people first hear about my psyllium it sounds like one of these, you know, amazing fantastical materials that probably just got stuck in a test tube and never scaled. And then when people actually see that no, this technology that he's scaling is actually being used and being adopted. It's, it's a, it's a really cool, like, a little a little sort of side note, like one of our, one of our co founders, he's the largest grower of exotic mushrooms in the countries. So that's tiny compared to your baton and portabello producers, you know, the so you're an okie inch attacchi, and things like that. Not those types of exotic mushrooms. But the and the, but I remember when we first saw him, you know, and we told this guy who was far more experienced than us with with all this technology with all the sight the space. And we were telling him how quickly we can grow this material room when we first saw him, he was almost like navfac off, like that's not, you know, awesome cap
we were like we were showing videos, and he was like, oh, wow, like I'm so you know, even people that have worked in the industry for decades, you know, have thought that this sounds impossible. But it's really cool. When you bet. Yeah, so I guess what, what's next is just having that plan built out of supply people?

<p>Yes and no, or like this might be unseen. Yep. So because we've been purposely like throttling or not, until very recently, really pushing ourselves out there. There's no we were still getting lots of demand because ecovative people talk to ecovative in Australia or New Zealand, or in that sort of a region, they will get pushed to us. So that was like, we were sort of building demand through that way. We We We went out to a couple of really big potential customers that we started working with sort of earlier, but they had that they're fine with expectations of this takes a long time. And we've seen like, like we're really sort of upskilling some of the other team members to help me with sales and stuff. It's been good because we've really been throttling it until very recently, because we didn't want to reach out to potential customers, build up all this hype, and then tell them that you've actually got to wait two or three years, until it's ready. We are now we're we're sort of that nine to 12 months out, out, now is that appropriate time to really start trying to gain reach out there. So we're starting it, and it's, it's coming in as we put more out there,
 
but,  you know, obviously, we want to keep growing it. So it hasn't felt like a problem yet. But you know, there's one that we want that interest to keep growing and growing.

<p>How do you guys tackle decision making as a team- especially because it sounds like youre operating under a fair amount of uncertainty?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> even from a pretty early stage had a governance board set up with one very senior experience person that isn't a co founder on that. So, you know, we we have meetings with them, you know, anywhere from one to three times a week. We've got ecovative, I, we have a direct line to ecovative and the other partners through slack. So we just hit we ever have like a problem or a question. Like, we've got great, a great community out there, both internally and externally, that we can get questions asked for. We've got a great team, like, you know, we've got a team where we, you know, we have we have meaningful conversations or viewpoints that are quite often different. But we've never got into an argument about anything. And like, we always come to, you know, what feels like the right decision. 
    
    It's lucky when you're in startup stage, and you're not going to market that's where you got lots of times, like, you know, we've done 100 edits after our final edit of our business plan. bus It's big, beyond what we thought was the final edit of our of our business plan and our aim, and you talk to invest, learn, and you update so but that we're really, really lucky when it comes to the actual manufacturing side of the business. So you know, we've got ecovative, who's done this before. So, you know, we've got that ability to read and learn from someone who's had lots of mistakes, and hopefully minimises the amount we make. But, but yeah, we've got a really strong network of a decent size team for a start up, we've got advisors, we've got ecovative and the investors that we're trying to bring on, you know, they bring a lot more than just the money as well. So it kind of feels like every time that we need to take a step up and growth, you know, the people or whoever is needed for that sort of come into play. So there's been, yeah.

<p>
    WHat advice might you give to your younger self or someone else starting out on this journey?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p>Well, the first bit of advice that I always give in, given that I've had previous businesses, is to just start. Not in a reckless way, but making that decision to really commit to what you want to do. There's so many people that have great ideas... I always had ideas, but I came to realise I was an expert, and sort of, you know, thinking what I needed to do to run a business from the point of where it was actually already set up. And then when I said I'd never start anything, and I'd sit there and be like, you know, ah, I don't know why this is happening, then when I came to realise quite often just taking that first step is, is normally free to do or it's very cheap, and start building momentum. So that's a little bit more sort of a broad first answer, but that's the biggest thing is actually, you know, plan Yes, like give that time to think about how you want to do things. But also, you know, remember that nothing is perfect, plans always change and the only way you're going to navigate your way through actually just starting and getting to it, the kind of ideas that are probably set in someone's head and never came to fruition, just because they didn't send that message.  Some people might think, oh, what if I say, I'm silly? What if I say, I'm stupid, what if I get rejected or psych, you know, who cares, it's like, you know, the feeling of rejection, you know, might make you feel silly for five minutes. But the, you know, the regret, of not doing something can last a lifetime. 
    
    So that's, and then I think, other advices, you know, there's always, which I think we've done really well has been, you know, really think about, like, who you're going to go into work with, you know, you're forming a relationship with them. make sure that who you go into work with the people that, you know, I think you can be friends with, you know, because you need, you need to have that because team is everything. 
    
    My advice is that, you know, especially in a startup, you know, team is 51% of the equation, the idea is 49%. And, you know, a great idea can go to ship with a bad team, an average idea can become successful with a great team. And lastly, actively invest a lot of time, energy and money into looking after your brain, your mental health and personal growth. Whether that's meditation, doing courses that are around, you know, my other, you know, sometimes non physical interests. And then you've got to have,  a business that you're passionate about, but you need to have other things in your life, whether that be sport, you know, something that you can take take, you know, because you have these 13 hour days, sometimes, but you got to, and that's fine, that's part of being a startup, and sometimes you're going to be extremely high stress level. So you got to make sure that you actively balance that out. I learned with this business, if I wasn't investing my time and doing my, you know, my meditation practices, breath practices, you know, going on, like many type of, you know, excursions for a few days to get away from work when I when I had that time. And those my capacity, you know, or stress levels would have gone up really high. And then when we had these critical moments in the business that were really stressful, I wouldn't have had that capacity to absorb that stress. And burnout, mental health, you know, your mental state, like, you have to look after that.  you've really got to learn how to, you know, restore your energy.  burnout hurts you, and you are forced to take time off because you might literally go temporarily insane because of the stress levels. You cannot, I can guarantee you you won't be able to control when that comes on. And if you allow that to happen, where you're forced to take time off your playing lotto as to when that time will be and that that's a crucial stage of your business. And you need to take time out. That can that can be something that you know if you can Want to buy, you know, what you might miss out on? If you're if you if that happens, there's probably $1 value to that that can be a make or break or, you know, something in the business. So
