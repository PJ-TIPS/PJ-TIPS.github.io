<p>Angelina and Tamara are the founders. They are both physiotherapists who met during their studies in Australia where they became best friends. Angelina always had this major interest in health and performance thanks to her work as a physio where she worked alongside high-profile athletes. During this period she was always looking for alternative and healthy food sources. After a period of  research she realised that all the seaweed outside of her little cabin in the north of Norway was full of nutrition. Yet, nobody was using it for anything. At that point she asked Tamara, her best friend for her opinion on the seaweed. That’s because Tamara is half-Japanese and grew up with it. 
    <br><br>
    
The next step involved bringing Tamara's mother up north to assess the viability of the idea and the quality of the seaweed. This involved plenty of additional research, testing, assessing and evaluating its nutritional value and creating a sustainable way to harvest it where the ecosystem is minimally disturbed. As a result, they began to hand harvest the seaweed in designated locations which allowed for sustainable harvesting involving cutting above the reproductive organ of the seaweed. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
Interestingly, we've actually seen that in these locations the following year there is even more seaweed because of the way we cut it without damaging the reproductive organ. The harvesting is one of the funnest things I've done, but also one of the best workouts I've ever had!

<p>How did you personally get involved in this team? </p>

    The team has had quite significant growth these past few years, and now they want to work more internationally. I've been working internationally for the past 10 years, both from Stockholm and from the UK. So I applied for the job as sales and marketing manager. What’s more, And I grew up close to Lofoten which was a draw and I really loved the idea of being involved with a sustainable food resource that is appropriate for vegan people and vegetarians because it is healthy, full of nutrition and also has this really beautiful flavour profile.
You can literally use it for anything. We have chocolates with seaweed, pasta with seaweed, and we even have a gin distillery company that uses our seaweed in there gin! As you can see, it's a very versatile product.

<p>Have you run into any challenges relating to industry regulation?  </p>

   <p> With regards to producing the mycelium at scale, the commercial mushroom-growing industries had already solved a lot of problems to do with regulation. With regards to regulation on our ideal substrate, hemp, the industry is continually growing and hopefully will continue to grow. If not, it's not so bad for us becuase hemp is not the only raw material we can use.

<p> We have a great community both internally and externally. We've got a great team and, from an early stage, we had a governance board set up. We have meetings with them anywhere from one to three times a week. 
    
    <br><br>
    
    We've also got our partnership with Ecovative, and we have a direct line to them if we ever have a problem or a question. Ecovative has been an amazing company to work with and their team is just as amazing as the technology itself!

    What advice would you give to your younger self or someone else starting out on this journey?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p>The first piece of advice is to really commit to starting. There's so many people that have great ideas but don't start. Quite often just taking that first step is free and will create some momentum.
    
    <br><br>
    
Secondly, think about who you're going to go into business with. Try to go into business with people who could be your friends because teamwork is everything. An average idea can become successful with a great team.
<br>
    <br>
Lastly, actively invest a lot of time, energy and money into looking after your brain, your mental health and your personal growth. Whether that's through meditation, courses or, say, sport. With a start-up you're going to be under extremely high stress at times. You have got to actively seek to restore your energy as burnout might hurt you and your business.
