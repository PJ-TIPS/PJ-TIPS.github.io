<p>What was the motivation behind creating The Seaweedman and Sea Green?

     <br>
<p>I noticed that our food system is unsustainable and what we're doing to our planet is actually the same as what we are doing to our bodies. I felt like we could do so much better as we are actually just wearing both things out. One of the easiest ways to correct these things is to start eating seaweed. One of the hardest parts of that mission is to make it attractive enough for ordinary people to actually go and try it and like it. To make that first step is very difficult. That's what motivates me to actually try and get seaweed as a part of the diet where it could very well contribute to a healthier world and a healthier food system. </p>

<p>What have been some of the challenges? </p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> Getting people to try it in the right way. Getting people to learn to appreciate seaweed for what it is which, in part, means getting experience cooking with it. We started sea green with seaweed burgers which is great- but what I've come to know over the last half year or so is that we are not solving a problem for people with a seaweed burger. So to say we are we're solving the wrong problem. We don't have a problem solution fit- seaweed versus chickpeas versus other alternative proteins is not a huge problem for veggie eaters. A majmor problem is that nobody really cares for veggie burgers anyway. Like it's it's really that bad. Yeah. So what we see is that a seaweed burger is not really good solution for people who want to eat more plant based as a more vegetarian or flexitarian whatever. These we sort of missed the boat also because people associate burgers with an indulging moment. that's what for example the company vegetarian butcher has kept. They've done such a good job there because they really keep the unhealthiness in veggie burger and they selling it well.  Seaweed is not that helpful as a meat replacer in veggie burgers, that's what we've come to know. The fish burgers of sea Green are selling a whole lot better because people understand  fish is healthy, seaweed is healthy and both come from sea. That's more of a problem solution fit. So say I want to eat some. Some I want to eat something healthy from the sale, let's get a seagreen burger. And yeah, it's taste salty.  </p>

<p>What's your perspective on the future of seaweed? </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
<p>Yeah, we're still in Kidergarden - and that's what people told me five years ago! so I thought it would be a whole lot different in like 2020/2021 but it's just not happening yet, especially in Europe, things go really, really slow. 

    
I think in Europe we want to score  quickly two products already on the market. We'd maybe have three that things that would actually already exist with people there to like it. So one is like Nori sheets, the other is wakame. Yeah, we can easily do that in Europe. 
    
If we don't commit on doing this, ourselves in Europe, the industry will remain small, remaining in kindergarden. That's in part because the government plays such a big role in giving out grants-  
Effectively they're in charge of who gets the money and who doesn't. 

However, if there's demand from the market, which obviously there is, should start working from that, to create that demand . Yeah,  I think if we were just smart, we should focus on that rather than trying to get people to eat, saccharina, or like, yeah, starting the next test farm, wherever with half an acre and then getting everyone to like invent their own wheel again. So we should definitely learn from Asia.  Get all the the expertise from there, copy it to here. I think that's what we should do for existing products, start our own seaweed supply chain. There's people working on that now however I can't see a big party fully committed into making that work because it's such a new industry for big players. So it's high risk. I think there's like 1000 other things in the food industry that are booming right now. Yeah, it's really like hyped up all, especially the plant based department. Everyone is trying to jump on to like the train day. And seaweed is on a backburner and noone is making any massive steps in Europe yet.

<p>We're going to do this crowdfunding campaign, starting in September. for some new products.  We have four different seaweeds in a new product release aimed to address problems regarding availability, how to use seaweed, what seaweed is all about and user-friendliness.

<p>Firstly, be sure about what problem you actually solving. So make sure there's a fit between the problems you actually notice and solutions that are out there.

<p> I recently read the book by Brian Smith, eat like a fish. I really enjoyed that. Otherwise, there are a lot of groups online where information is shared- a lot of good information can be found out there about seaweed.
