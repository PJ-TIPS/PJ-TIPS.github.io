    What was the motivation behind creating The Seaweedman and Sea Green?
    
  I witnessed  that our food systems were unsustainable what we're doing to our planet is unsustainabkle- can do much better- wearing out theings- need to do things differently- one of the easiest ways to do it is using seaweed.
    
    Challenges?
    
    hardest part of that is to make it attractive enough for ordinary People. So say to actually go and try and like it It's not that Mark the like wants you Get to it but the first app is really really hard. 
    
    Let's say we become a part of a diet I wouldn't say like stable. it's The next staple food and we could Contribute to a healthier world a healthier food system Sure and we could always make it a staple food future we should appreciate it. 
    
   Getting people to trying seaweed in the right way is one of the challenges-  We started sea green with seaweed burgers obviously because burger is a nice way of trying something but then Tried it. realised in last half year- or so is that we are not solving A problem repeater with a seaweed burger so say we're we're solving The wrong problem. we don't have a 
    problem solution fit.We make a veggie burger and it's for people who want to replace so Is just a solution or them But whether that have seaweed are chickpeas whatever That's we also see like on the shelves Changing all the time in the world because Nobody really cares for veggie burgers
    
   Seaweed burger is not really good solution for people Want to eat more plant based. Twe missed the boat also because People associate- burgers with indulgent moment- nto a healthy moment- so to link it with an unhealthy moment is a problem. Is a whole problem of the veggie burger anyway people's Burgers
    
    vegetarian butcher They done such a good job they're because they really keeps unhealthiness 
    in the veggie burger and they selling Well it looks like me anyways but really It's just a 1 USB Mongolia go to mimic meat Including the bat health Yeah so seaweed is not the helpful as a meal replacer In veggie burgers that's all we've come No fish burgers of sea green egg selling all up in it Because people understand like fish is healthy seaweed healthy both come from c Saudi flavour and they really enjoy that so that's that's more of a problem solution fit- I want to eat some I will eat something healthy from the sea- ok let's get a sea green burger. 
    
    
    Other challenges ?
    
    Try and get people to appreciate seaweed- which means Cooking with it themselves and Get it Out of the scary ingredients shelf in your mind. The shelf Next to salt and pepper and herbs new kitchen Together
    
    What's your perspectvie on the industry- where do you think it's going in the next 10- 15 years.
    
    Where is still In kindergarten Burner people told me 5 years ago I thought it would be home I thought would be would be getting some more mature like at least two Who is the primary school Is just Not happening No it's basically in Europe Dingo really really slow I like to look at the stage you 
    
    
    "bro no brand Smiths Have you talked to him I should do that he's doing like good job in like at least Sally noodles is not like big Yeah yeah Only selling a little bit But yeah Lyndon again like what I see I just finished looking like a crowdfunding video for a late veggie pasta We have veggie wraps which will also makes it could be Good veggie replacer And 
    
    then it could be at some some alternative veggie replacement really something that's even better than vegetable REST Industry I think in Europe We want to score it a quick litres to products already on the market Or maybe 3 dad that would actually already two people they're like it so The one is like nori sheets Yeah we can easily do that in Europe but we 't think it's stupid Because we have her own seaweed but we focus on the wrong thing or we can set up Focus on the second line So yeah I think it's that stupid would we talking about this with You talk to the North Sea Ben Lee Oh my god see you tomorrow with them And we're on the beach and collect all different types of seaweed so they went for What's this What year Bush Innovation forward They were working 
    
    on that we could do that and Europe We should start producing locally Just salad I think it's really good starting point because everyone loves that And then Yeah Downside 
    
    
    What are the implications of trying to work with local suppliers and domestic markets?
    
    Yeah Yeah yeah it's the chicken or the egg we always say If we Don't commit on doing this our cells in the industry - it will remain small- remaining Always yeah Bag video subsidies for the government Did Darren charge you know who gets the money who doesn't so you get like some really Crazy strange research projects and then we don't move There's the man from the market which obviously there is start working from that Creating that demand also Yeah They'll be awesome to do I think if we Smart we should focus on that rather than Trying to get people easy Corona or like Starting the next Best Barwon River half an acre and then getting every Find too late inventor all-wheel Again Yeah so we should definitely learn from Asia that's one thing so it's the other way around All the the expertise from their computers here I think that's all we should do Existing products Seaweed Supply chain Is 
    
    people working on that now I can't see you like A big party like fully committed into making them work 
    
    Why?
    
    Well big parties see sort it like a new industry so- Generally high risk. Big bodies usually Usually risk avoidance So yeah that's when Refused a small egg like Bitcoin Yeah really high return on investment Would you go to be committed to take risk I like Yeah I think there is like 1000 things in the food industry right now whic hare booming. Eeryone s Jumping onto the train there but not big steps in Euope- just Asia.
    
    Surely getting enough supply is a huge problem in Europe- surley not enough volume? (minute 19:36) 
    
    thinking about it looking at No it's really making like a big steps Europe They have it all their Just like copy paste Organic volume is not yet it's it's The main problem first and Get enough demand directly create volume and then Rolling Stones getting becoming the volume that's when you have messages coming So At the moment we never had any trouble with our supplier of seaweed supplying Your mom's house We are with winning ys600 supermarkets at the same time At the moment we just in waitrose and UK There is a few wholesalers in Nedlands Now that the bars and restaurants are opening up again get little bit more volume Star yeah 
    
    it's not really like a big demand So yeah Everyone to work on Siri The only way that works because you can't get through concept investors like Project what you do with seaweed what you have it Like it's not really clear generally food site I just finished work with my intern she just finished rojak You're the first I am actually showing Yeah The what will do Is just a try out like we're going to do is crowdfunding campaign Starting in September Anyway I got open this You should have told me so We have is the four different seaweed a 
    
    lot of consumer research What do people want from Siri what are the biggest problems in terms of When is availability So they can't get it in supermarket Johnny store get used bag What do you do with it Second is Make what do I make with it what to do with my kitchen so it's like a user-friendly Is terrible with the products that are on the market So we try to solve that problem by QR codes Show weather for brass If there's a market for it So should be a QR code here You scan it you get all recipes This is for Instruction video what is there where you come from Mine is just Simple basic clue what to do with sea lettuce Just 
    
    don't know so why would I spend like 3 for yiros I don't know what to do with it looks like fish don't do it Yeah so Dad We see now and we got from human surveys was really busy with the last Humans Yeah so is the accessibility and the user friendly nests all those problems and then you have Speedwell willing to pay three 5 Euros for in this former decided They can take like 5 meals are there Easily gather Yeah Is reasonable there especially because you 
    
    get like in terms of flavour You got really like something different on your plate And that's what people say looking for Do chefs and influencers so I'll be working on that you come back from Today's the crowdfunding campaign video And we were live 15th December Well yeah I don't know I really wanted to Yeah the correct code Supply blah blah blah We could blues all seaweed at will easily I'm really comfortable that Just like we never ever Thought of how to Make it Yeah Make it work for people also Yeah Yeah yeah yeah Yeah birthdays are

    Adventures Dan Murphy's taken off Oh no Yeah Sorry see you in project but there are called seaweed Adventures on Facebook of something Yeah Siri broken Yeah Have you talked to Stefan Stefan Grant Here is the most enthusiastic person I know on this stopping There is also a couple that you started Siri journey Adventure Seaweed But that's just That's a different one They're all seaweed adventurous And they are travelling now in a van Europe Do also visit all this nice Siri place is actually Create I have them on Instagram My goodness See if I would I can do for you right here Because everyone's like Really really into it This 
    
    guy always Have you talked to talk ill yet Do killed engines Ok is a Danish guys very old Yeah and he's is like girl he's like Stefan is Moira scientist so say So is really I think He knows better than anyone else in the world How seaweed is How it's how it should be I should find out how you should have them all technology Behind that is really good with Seaweed company now it's actually farming quiet A bit of the aleria in Ireland And he's putting it into like things like beer to meet replaces Whatever so yeah Are you doing it together with those guy called yours brother might be really cool to talk to you because 
    
    they have The scientific background on one hand On the other hand also the The actual fireman network to Lake Throw it out there so Yes year service quite good with the email and all that and LinkedIn Or if he doesn't reply or O's Connect to view You too mate
    Beer
Not so bad how's yourself
Yeah that's it
Yeah
Bubbles
Yep
My parents place in a raging few things
Ready to go back home and then start holidays so three like finish
All the last bits of PC
Exotic
I hope to go to Ron's bird
Like the the number of new covert
Cases is just like I think yesterday we had new ones today we have
So it's like grown exponentially again just got the vaccine yesterday
Yeah yeah
I was little bit chivalry last night
But that was it for now
So
Gonna have to
Motivation
Is Dad I
Have witnessed myself that our food system is unsustainable what we're doing to our plan
That would do into a body slam
We are we could do so much better we're actually just
Wearing wearing both things out brother's of bodies in the world I believe we can do thing
Differently
What is the easiest ways to do it start eating seaweed
And a hardest part of that is to make it attractive enough for Ordinary People
So say to actually go and try and like it
It's not that
Mark the like wants you
Get to it but the first app is really really hot
Motorbikes
Let's see we become a part of a diet I wouldn't say like stable it's
The next staple food
Photo very well
Contribute to a healthier world a healthier food system
Sure and we could always make it a staple food future we should appreciating it
Actually is Google
Yeah trying it in the right way
We started sea green with seaweed burgers obviously
Because burger is a nice way of trying something but then
Tried it Lee
Put it in the right way whatever
Half year or so is that we are not solving
A problem repeater with a seaweed burger so say we're we're solving
The wrong problem we don't have a problem solution fit we we
We make a veggie burger and it's for people who want to replace so
Is just a solution or them
But whether that have seaweed are chickpeas whatever
That's we also see like on the shelves
Changing all the time in the world because
Nobody really cares for veggie burgers
It's really loud but so are we
Yeah not make Siri burger is not really good solution for people
Want to eat more plant based
These we should have missed the boat also because
People associate Lake burgers
Is a whole problem of the veggie burger anyway people's Burgers with
I need Aussie moment
So moment can really eat like crap but then it feels like really
Really healthy really really good to her brain but it doesn't feel healthy like and then
Is it a have this link with a healthy and tasty
And that's were for example vegetarian butcher
They done such a good job they're because they really keeps unhealthiness in the veggie burger and they selling
Well it looks like me anyways but really
It's just a 1 USB Mongolia go to mimic meat
Including the bat health
Yeah so seaweed is not the helpful as a meal replacer
In veggie burgers that's all we've come
No fish burgers of sea green egg selling all up in it
Because people understand like fish is healthy seaweed healthy both come from c
Saudi flavour and they really enjoy that so that's that's more of a pro
Say I want to eat some
I will eat something healthy from the sia let's get a sea green burger
Cools flavour of the ocean that's more logical
Proposition
Your question was is it
Challenge
For now I can only see
We
Wish try and learn to appreciate Siri what is
This means
Cooking with it people cooking with it themselves and
Get it
Out of the scary ingredients shelf in your mind
The shelf
Next to salt and pepper and herbs new kitchen
Together
Where is still
In kindergarten
Burner people told me 5 years ago I thought it would be home
I thought would be would be getting some more mature like at least two
Who is the primary school
Is just
Not happening
No it's basically in Europe
Dingo really really slow
I like to look at the stage you bro no brand Smiths
Have you talked to him
I should do that he's doing like good job in like at least
Sally noodles is not like big
Yeah yeah
Only selling a little bit
But yeah
Lyndon again like what I see
I just finished looking like a crowdfunding video for a late veggie pasta
We have veggie wraps which will also makes it could be
Good veggie replacer
And then it could be at some some alternative veggie replacement really something that's even better than vegetable
REST Industry
I think in Europe
We want to score it a quick litres to products already on the market
Or maybe 3 dad that would actually already two people they're like it so
The one is like nori sheets
Yeah we can easily do that in Europe but we don't think it's stupid
Because we have her own or we can set up
Focus on the second line
So yeah I think it's that stupid would we talking about this with
You talk to the North Sea
Ben Lee
Oh my god see you tomorrow with them
And we're on the beach and collect all different types of seaweed so they went for
What's this
What year
Bush Innovation forward
They were working on that we could do that and Europe
We should start producing locally
Just British salad
I think it's really good starting point because everyone loves that
And then
Yeah
Downside
Yeah
Yeah yeah it's the chicken or the egg we always say
If we
Don't commit on doing this our cells in the industry will remain small remaining
Always yeah Bag video subsidies for the government
Did Darren charge you know who gets the money who doesn't so you get like some really
Crazy strange research projects and then we don't move
There's the man from the market which obviously there is start working from that
Creating that demand also
Yeah
They'll be awesome to do
I think if we
Smart we should focus on that rather than
Trying to get people easy Corona or like
Starting the next
Best Barwon River half an acre and then getting every
Find too late inventor all-wheel
Again
Yeah so we should definitely learn from Asia that's one thing so it's the other way around
All the the expertise from their computers here
I think that's all we should do
Existing products
Seaweed
Supply chain
Is people working on that now
I can't see you like
A big party like fully committed into making them work
Do you know where is the
Yeah
Well they see sort of
Like it's a new industry
Generally high risk in big bodies and not
Usually risk avoidance
So yeah that's when
Refused a small egg like Bitcoin
Yeah really high return on investment
Would you go to be committed to take risk
I like
Yeah I think there is like 1000 things in the street right now
Yeah it's really like a hyped up all especially good plumbase
Department everyone is
Jump onto the train there
And Siri the story of like I did something we do that later so everyone's thinking about it looking at
No it's really making like a big steps Europe
They have it all their
Just like copy paste
Organic volume is not yet it's it's
The main problem first and
Get enough demand directly create volume and then
Rolling Stones getting becoming the volume that's when you have messages coming
So
At the moment we never had any trouble with our supplier of seaweed supplying
Your mom's house
We are with winning ys600 supermarkets at the same time
At the moment we just in waitrose and UK
There is a few wholesalers in Nedlands
Now that the bars and restaurants are opening up again get little bit more volume
Star yeah it's not really like a big demand
So yeah
Everyone to work on Siri
The only way that works because you can't get through concept investors like
Project what you do with seaweed what you have it
Like it's not really clear generally food site
I just finished work with my intern she just finished rojak
You're the first I am actually showing
Yeah
The what will do
Is just a try out like we're going to do is crowdfunding campaign
Starting in September
Anyway I got open this
You should have told me so
We have is the four different seaweed a lot of consumer research
What do people want from Siri what are the biggest problems in terms of
When is availability
So they can't get it in supermarket Johnny store get used bag
What do you do with it
Second is
Make what do I make with it what to do with my kitchen so it's like a user-friendly
Is terrible with the products that are on the market
So we try to solve that problem by QR codes
Show weather for brass
If there's a market for it
So should be a QR code here
You scan it you get all recipes
This is for
Instruction video what is there where you come from
Mine is just
Simple basic clue what to do with sea lettuce
Just don't know so why would I spend like 3 for yiros
I don't know what to do with it looks like fish don't do it
Yeah so
Dad
We see now and we got from human surveys was really busy with the last
Humans
Yeah so is the accessibility and the user friendly nests all those problems and then you have
Speedwell willing to pay three 5 Euros for in this former decided
They can take like 5 meals are there
Easily gather
Yeah
Is reasonable there especially because you get like in terms of flavour
You got really like something different on your plate
And that's what people say looking for
Do chefs and influencers so I'll be working on that you come back from
Today's the crowdfunding campaign video
And we were live 15th December
Well yeah
I don't know
I really wanted to
Yeah the correct code
Supply blah blah blah
We could blues all seaweed at will easily
I'm really comfortable that
Just like we never ever
Thought of how to
Make it
Yeah
Make it work for people also
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah birthdays are
Be sure what problem you actually say
Adobe domain
Advice because
Obviously is nice to do you get a lot of energy because she feels like you are saving the world
German
But then
If you understand how that world really works it might not be the world might be waiting for
Your solution anyhow
So make sure there is a fit between
The problems you actually notice and solutions are out there
Solutions to offer
See if your solution is better than the ones that are
Right there now
What is do it for yourself but then make it a nice hobby
Bugs sorry
Books bugs
You're now what I just recently read was the book by Brent Smith like
Eat like a fish
I really enjoy that
I enjoyed leg work with Steph
Full diamond armour would like an apprenticeship work later on also
So that was it was great
Yeah just
There's a lot of
Facebook groups in groups of information exchange
Really a lot of actually good info by seaweed
Ring me think
Anyone have leaked
Good
Not really like this not really girl
Good documentaries of the guys from Germany to make seaweed adventure
You are you may have heard that
Yeah it's not a girl I think
Jacob Mount Alford
India one
Yeah I should have this brand now you may have interviewed them like
Got the name I think you're doing quite well in your organic stores
Allergan London
You have laid series spreads
Making a documentary about see we find out what it's really about
Play heard so much about the future so they actually team travelling to Asia
Seaweed Siri professor
We're going improving quality is really really notice stuff
So much better than kindergarten
Yeah
I think it's on YouTube
Quickly
Seaweed Adventures
Dan Murphy's taken off
Oh no
Yeah
Sorry see you in project but there are called seaweed Adventures on Facebook of something
Yeah
Siri broken
Yeah
Have you talked to Stefan
Stefan Grant
Here is the most enthusiastic person I know on this stopping
There is also a couple that you started Siri journey
Adventure
Seaweed
But that's just
That's a different one
They're all seaweed adventurous
And they are travelling now in a van Europe
Do also visit all this nice Siri place is actually
Create I have them on
Instagram
My goodness
See if I would I can do for you right here
Because everyone's like
Really really into it
This guy always
Have you talked to talk ill yet
Do killed engines
Ok is a Danish guys very old
Yeah and he's is like girl he's like
Stefan is Moira scientist so say
So is really
I think
He knows better than anyone else in the world
How seaweed is
How it's how it should be
I should find out how you should have them all technology
Behind that is really good with
Seaweed company now it's actually farming quiet
A bit of the aleria in Ireland
And he's putting it into like things like beer to meet replaces
Whatever so yeah
Are you doing it together with those guy called yours brother might be really cool to talk to you because they have
The scientific background on one hand
On the other hand also the
The actual fireman network to Lake
Throw it out there so
Yes year service quite good with the email and all that and LinkedIn

     <br>
<p>We wanted to do something where we could personally have an impact. The oceans and forests are a huge source of pleasure for us. We've always been into the sustainability ecosystem, especially in our native Monaco. After single-use plastics from groceries and online shopping started to stack up at home it became clear that there was a problem. We started looking into packaging alternatives which would be more sustainable than current products. The conclusion was to use seaweed to create a bioplastic- FlexSea.  </p>

<p>Carlo had the original idea and, after a year and a half of work, decided that he needed someone with a more scientific background to join him. We are both originally from Monaco and already knew each other from there. We got back in touch when Carlo moved to London. Then, one Sunday morning he called me and said “I have this idea - it's about bioplastics and you could do the R&D.” So I joined the venture as a CTO and we’ve since made good progress with the prototype. Now with some product development, a lot of research and plenty of idea- generation, we have a patent on the prototype. </p>

<p>Could you tell me what the biggest challenges have been so far and how you’ve overcome them?</p>

<p>Carlo: A few main challenges stand out. The first being my lack of any deep scientific experience. I loved the challenge of learning but, naturally, at some point I just needed more expertise. 

The second challenge was financial.  We’re bootstrapped so we have to do things locally at the moment. Despite this, we’ve managed to do really well and we’re working on fundraising. Fundraising is a challenge in itself. 
</p>
                        
                    
<p>Thibaut: On the topic of fundraising, a story my academic tutor tells me is that, if you're lucky, five percent of your time as a professor is spent in the lab and the other 95 percent is spent looking for funding. It's something you need to consider early. 
    
Another challenge is that when you leave university, you often realise that you don't know anything. In terms of developing a real technical product, you might know nothing. That was a really hard thing to accept at first.  Thinking outside the box is a skill we had to develop. If you want to do something new, you need to develop that bit of imagination.

<p>How are you guys learning on the job? Given that juggling the building and the learning is difficult at times, what strategies do you have to stay on top of things?</p>
    </b>
    </div>
     <br>
            
<p>I think the question is how do you keep learning in a methodical way. There are an infinite number of things to learn. If you tried to go in every direction, you lose your time. We needed to learn how to divide the tasks and not try to stay on top of everything. 

There are three obvious ways to learn in a start-up. Number one- keep reading. Books, articles and reports on business, science and much more. There is so much to consume and it really makes the difference. 
    
    <br>
    <br>

Number two, talk to people. It's vital. Get advisers. We're lucky enough to have an adviser with 30 years of experience in startups and scale ups. He's always pushing us to be better.
    
    <br>
    <br>

Number three, it’s not really a strategy but a reality that you're forced to learn when you're up against a stone wall. Even if you don't see the learning opportunity when you’re up against an impossible task, you will still learn something because you discover new things every time you do something. Especially in the startup, entrepreneurial life.

<p>So you’ve touched on the power of mentorship in navigating this career path but, in your opinions, what are the most common reasons for deep-tech start-ups to fail?
</p>
    
    <br>
    
          </b>
    </div>
<p> Fundraising and money are definitely key reasons. A problem with fundraising in deep-tech is time-span. You have to consider that investors are looking for a return on investment. Ten years invested in deep tech is an awfully long time and puts a lot of investors off. Then, once you have funding you can stumble by spending too much, or spending too little and not making enough progress. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>

Another reason for failing is because you don't build a strong foundation. There's a lot of things that can go wrong in business and you have to be prepared. If you’re not looking around making sure that everything you do is right, stuff can go very, very badly. It's like if you're building your house, every brick counts.

<p>It’s really about talking to each other and having good communication. At the end of the day two heads are better than one. </p>

<p>On the technical side, we need to keep improving the product. For this we need to get a chemical engineer or a polymer scientist. This all means funding. So the second goal is to raise more money and find a new lab. We’ve been accepted into the Mass Challenge Accelerator in Switzerland which will help us here.

<p>I think our experience shows that you don't necessarily need a technical background to make progress in deep tech. So, if you have a passion and an interest in something you can get some seriously good work done.
Another thing is to think about fundraising early. Getting the fuel into the car is one of the hardest parts for a lot of entrepreneurs.
