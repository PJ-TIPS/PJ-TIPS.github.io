<p> It was a real pleasure to speak with Willem, an entrepreneur, mentor and investor with a whole host of experience across different industries.  In this edited conversation with Peter Green, Willem spoke about some of the challenges he's experienced leading Seamore and what's next for the company.    </p>

<p>I've been an entrepreneur for a long time and I had just finished my journey with Buzzer, my previous business in the marketing world.  I've always enjoyed undertaking seemingly impossible projects because I like the quest that needs to take place. As a result, I was on the lookout for a new revolution to kickstart when I chanced upon this idea.

One night, when I was out for dinner on the island of Ibiza, I ordered a 'seaweed salad' from the menu. I was expecting something really exotic and exciting, however, when it arrived I couldn’t see it on the plate... It was only after going to the chef that I realised that the green pasta on my plate was the seaweed! It was a unique kind of seaweed that grows on the rocks and looks just like tagliatelle! 
    
    <br>
<br>

This experience blew my mind and what followed from this was plenty of research. I found out quickly that nobody was really explaining how you could turn seaweed into great food. It was very clear that nobody had figured out how to get it on people's plates except in Asia. I realised at this moment that I could fix that with my background in business and marketing.

<p> In Europe the seaweed industry is still only interesting to a very small group of people. As a food company we want to reach a much larger audience than that. We want to connect with all those people who want better food. That's why it was important for us to focus less on selling seaweed products and more on selling tasty, better food with less guilt attached. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
The lesson here is that you need to be wary of navel gazing as an entrepreneur. If you are not wary, you are not going to learn what people really want.

Initially we sold the seaweed pasta, the seaweed bacon and the most elegant, impactful, fantastic products that you can think of. Was there a problem here? Well yes. Despite getting the price down by 50% through our scaling, it is still too niche and expensive for most people!

    In order to capture a larger audience, we stopped promoting seaweed as a staple, vegetable food-product like cucumber or eggplants. Instead, we started developing wraps, chips and bread using seaweed. The larger audience needed better food that was not too dissimilar from their current diet. This is why we also turned to a second range of products - hybrid products.</p>

<p>From a diet perspective, all kinds of functional benefits of seaweed are being discovered in the food industry. With time we will see more seaweed as a <b>pure</b> ingredient on our dishes.  
    
<br> 
    <br> 
On the supply side there will be lots of changes too. This is because seaweed is becoming a common ingredient in many industries. As a result, scaling supply will be important as the demand is rising. Eventually we, as seaweed product designers, can actually help the supply side to scale quickly. Currently the domestic market volumes are not great enough in Europe.

<p>What I find really exciting is our development of a range of fish alternatives. Micro algae are a fantastic source of protein and have a very interesting blend of nutrients and flavour. I'm really excited about this at the moment and now we have to turn this into a reality.
