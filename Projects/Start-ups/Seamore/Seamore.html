<p>I've been an entrepreneur for a long time and I had just finished my journey with my previous business in the marketing world called buzzer.  I've always enjoyed undertaking impossible tasks which nobody else believes in. That's because I like the quest that needs to take place. As a result, I was on the lookout for a new revolution to kickstart. 
    
    <br>

One night, when I was out for dinner on the island of Ibiza, there was something called the seaweed salad on the menu which seemed really exotic and exciting. However, when it arrived, I couldn’t see it on the plate. I went to the chef and began to ask him where it was whereupon he pointed to the pasta on my plate and explained that this was the seaweed. It was a unique kind of seaweed that grows on the rocks and looks just like tagliatelle! 

This experience blew my mind.  What followed from this was plenty of research. I found out pretty quickly that nobody was really explaining how you could turn seaweed into great food. It was very clear that nobody had figured out how to get it on people's plates except in Asia where it had been a staple for centuries. I realised at this moment that I could fix that with my background in business and marketing.

<p>What are some of the challenges you’ve encountered on this journey and how have you overcome these?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> One of the challenges in Europe is that the seaweed industry is still only interesting to a very small group of people. As a food company we want to reach a much larger audience than that. We want to connect with all those people who want better food. That's why it was important for us to focus less on selling seaweed products and more on selling tasty, better food with less guilt attached. 
    
    <br>
    
The lesson here is that you need to be wary of navel gazing as an entrepreneur. If you are not you are not going to learn what people really want. 
    
<br>
    
Initially we sold the seaweed pasta, the seaweed bacon and the most elegant, impactful, fantastic products that you can think of. Was this a problem? Well yes. It is still too niche and expensive for most people! Despite getting the price down by 50% through our scaling most people are still not up for it for variety of reasons. The solution, designed in order to capture a larger audience was to shift (for now) from using and promoting seaweed as an everyday staple food like cucumber or eggplants. This is why we started developing the wraps, chips and the bread. The larger audience needed better food but food that was not too different from what they already knew. This is why we also turned to the second range of products - hybrid products.</p>
                        
                        <br>

<p>What’s your outlook on the future of seaweed in the food industry?

 </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
<p>It seems that all kinds of functional benefits of seaweed are being discovered by the use of seaweed in the food industry. With time we will slowly see more seaweed as a pure ingredient on our dishes. Then there’s the supply side where there will be a lot of changes. This is because seaweed is becoming a more common ingredient in industrial applications; from cosmetics to textiles to plastics. With all that going on, scaling supply will be important as the demand is rising. In the West people are starting to see that it’s becoming more serious. With this we will eventually get into a position where we as seaweed product designers can actually help the supply side to scale quickly. Currently the domestic market volumes are not great enough in Europe. 

So that so that the economies of scale become better because that's, that's obviously one of the difficult things is that initially, the scale is not big, then the high, which prevents you from having a competitive product.

<p>What I find really exciting is our development of a range of fish alternatives. Micro algae are a fantastic source of protein, micro algae, very interesting nutrients, but also flavour. And they can have a great role in binding because of the alginates that are in there and etc, etc. So now, what I'm thinking of is using both micro algae and micro algae to create these alternative fish products. So that's, that's, you know, what I'm really excited about at the moment. And now we just need to, you know, turn that into a reality.

<p>For me, the most important lesson is that and this is explained the kind of the mistake I made, I was so passionate about the solution, seaweed, that I forgot to see that ultimately people have relatively primal needs, emotional needs, and you need to figure out what's, what's going on there and how, how your solution can help, you know, address needs that people already have. Because the big thing is if you're if, you know, if you want to create a new need, it's gonna take decades, and it's simply too much of a struggle. So, you know, if you want to create the need for people to eat, see me, it's too hard, if you want to create a guilt free snack, that works, because they already have the need for a guilt free snack. So if I link seaweed, in the nachos that we make, to the need for people to have a guilt free snack, to feel less guilty about what they give their kids, etc. to have a convenient, great looking side dish that we're now that's how we're positioning the CV chips in the world of service, then then you're linking something to something that already exists, and then that's more that's a flow, then that works. So the big mistake is not to do that and to think that everybody's going to be as excited about your solution. But you don't have you haven't created the link with an existing important, urgent need. So that that's I think, the biggest one and validate that to really make sure that this need exists, and that people can see how the C suite addresses that. And the best example is what I explained about the meat, you know, okay, so there's a huge need for alternative meat products that is easily validated, but you also need to validate that on a psychological level. People are Yeah, and and seaweed is a logical You know, ingredient part of this alternative meat product. So so that's that's where I think people need to be really critical that they they create something that addresses an existing need.

<p>So you’ve touched on the power of mentorship in navigating this career path but, in your opinions, what are the most common reasons for deep-tech start-ups to fail?
</p>
    
    <br>
    
          </b>
    </div>
<p> Fundraising and money are definitely key reasons. A problem with fundraising in deep-tech is time-span. You have to consider that investors are looking for a return on investment. Ten years invested in deep tech is an awfully long time and puts a lot of investors off. Then, once you have funding you can stumble by spending too much, or spending too little and not making enough progress. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>

Another reason for failing is because you don't build a strong foundation. There's a lot of things that can go wrong in business and you have to be prepared. If you’re not looking around making sure that everything you do is right, stuff can go very, very badly. It's like if you're building your house, every brick counts.

<p>On the technical side, we need to keep improving the product. For this we need to get a chemical engineer or a polymer scientist. This all means funding. So the second goal is to raise more money and find a new lab. We’ve been accepted into the Mass Challenge Accelerator in Switzerland which will help us here.

<p>I think our experience shows that you don't necessarily need a technical background to make progress in deep tech. So, if you have a passion and an interest in something you can get some seriously good work done.
Another thing is to think about fundraising early. Getting the fuel into the car is one of the hardest parts for a lot of entrepreneurs.
