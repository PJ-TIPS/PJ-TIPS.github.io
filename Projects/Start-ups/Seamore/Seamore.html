In this edited conversation with Peter Green, Willem spoke about some of the challenges he's experienced leading Seamore and what's next for the company.    </p>

<p>I've been an entrepreneur for a long time and I had just finished my journey with Buzzer, my previous business in the marketing world.  I've always enjoyed undertaking seemingly impossible projects because I like the quest that needs to take place. As a result, I was on the lookout for a new revolution to kickstart when I chanced upon this idea.

One night when I was out for dinner on the island of Ibiza, I ordered a 'seaweed salad' from the menu. I was expecting something really exotic and exciting, however, when it arrived I couldn’t see it on the plate... It was only after going to the chef that I realised that the green pasta on my plate was the seaweed! It was a unique kind of seaweed that grows on the rocks and looks just like tagliatelle! 
    
    <br>
<br>

This experience blew my mind and what followed from this was plenty of research. I found out pretty quickly that nobody was really explaining how you could turn seaweed into great food. It was very clear that nobody had figured out how to get it on people's plates except in Asia where it had been a staple for centuries. I realised at this moment that I could fix that with my background in business and marketing.

<p>What are some of the challenges you’ve encountered on this journey and how have you overcome these?</p>

 </div>
<p> One of the challenges in Europe is that the seaweed industry is still only interesting to a very small group of people. As a food company we want to reach a much larger audience than that. We want to connect with all those people who want better food. That's why it was important for us to focus less on selling seaweed products and more on selling tasty, better food with less guilt attached. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
The lesson here is that you need to be wary of navel gazing as an entrepreneur. If you are not wary, you are not going to learn what people really want.

Initially we sold the seaweed pasta, the seaweed bacon and the most elegant, impactful, fantastic products that you can think of. Was there a problem here? Well yes. It is still too niche and expensive for most people! Despite getting the price down by 50% through our scaling, most people are still not up for it for various reasons. 
                    <br>

    The solution we designed to capture a larger audience was to move away from promoting seaweed as an everyday staple food like cucumber or eggplants. This is why we started developing the wraps, chips and the bread. The larger audience needed better food but food that was not too different from what they already know. This is why we also turned to a second range of products - hybrid products.</p>

<p>What’s your outlook on the future of seaweed in the food industry?

 </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
<p>It seems that all kinds of functional benefits of seaweed are being discovered by the use of seaweed in the food industry. With time we will slowly see more seaweed as a pure ingredient on our dishes. Then there’s the supply side where there will be a lot of changes. 
    
<br> 
    <br> 
This is because seaweed is becoming a more common ingredient in industrial applications; from cosmetics to textiles to plastics. With all that going on, scaling supply will be important as the demand is rising. In the West, people are starting to see that it’s becoming more serious. With this we will eventually get into a position where we, as seaweed product designers, can actually help the supply side to scale quickly. Currently the domestic market volumes are not great enough in Europe.

<p>What I find really exciting is our development of a range of fish alternatives. Micro algae are a fantastic source of protein and have a very interesting blend of nutrients and flavour. I'm really excited about this at the moment and now we have to turn this into a reality.

<p>For me, there was one big mistake I made. I was so passionate about the solution, seaweed, that I forgot to see how the solution could help address people's primal, emotional needs. You need to solve an existing, important, urgent need.
