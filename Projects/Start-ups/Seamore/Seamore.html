<p>What was the motivation behind creating Seamore?

     <br>
<p>I've been an entrepreneur for a long time and I had just finished my previous business which had been in the marketing world with my company buzzer.  I enjoy the impossible stuff, the stuff that nobody believes in because I like the quest that needs to take place so I was on a lookout for a new revolution to kickstart. 

When I was out for dinner on the island of Ibiza there was something called the seaweed salad on the menu which seemed really exotic and exciting. However, when it arrived I couldn’t see it on the plate. So… I went to the chef and asked him where it was? After a moment he pointed to the pasta on my plate and explained that this was a unique kind of seaweed that grows on the rocks, looking just like tagliatelle. 

That blew my mind.  I started to do some research after this experience and I quickly found out that nobody was really explaining how you could turn seaweed into great food. It was very clear that nobody had figured out how to get it on people's plates except in Asia where it had been a staple for centuries. I figured that with my background I could fix that.

<p>What are some of the challenges you’ve encountered on this journey and how are you solving these?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> One of the challenges in the seaweed industry is that in Europe it is still only interesting to a very small group of people. As a food company we want to reach a much larger audience who just want better food as opposed to just this small group. That's why it was important for us to focus less on selling seaweed products and more on selling tasty, better food with less guilt. You need to be wary of navel staring or you’re not going to learn what people really. So you know, initially we sold the seaweed pasta and bacon, and the most elegant, impactful, fantastic products that you can think of. Problem? Yeah… still too niche for most people and it's too expensive still- , even though we got the price down by 50% through our scaling. Most people are still not up for it. So in order to capture a larger audience we needed to shift from using and promoting seaweed as everyday food like cucumber or eggplant (which is the dream) to a different product. This is why we started developing the wraps, chips and the bread…. because this larger audience simply needed better food, but not too different for what they already knew. This is why we also turned to the second range of products, which is, let's call it hybrid, where we try to put as much seaweed in as possible, up to the point where it still accessible in taste and texture and price and all that.</p>
                        
                        <br>

<p>What’s your outlook on the future of seaweed in the food industry?

 </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
<p>It seems that all kinds of functional benefits are being discovered by seaweed in the food industry and slowly we will see more seaweed as a pure ingredient on your dish. Then there’s the supply side where there will be a lot of changes because seaweed is becoming a much more used ingredient for all kinds of other applications, from cosmetics to textile to plastics. And with all that going on, obviously, there's scaling, the demand is rising. 
In the West people are thinking… we can't miss this boat and it’s becoming more serious with the scale increasing, and people learning. Then we will get into a position where we can actually help the supply side to scale quickly. Currently the domestic market volumes are not great enough in Europe. 

So that so that the economies of scale become better because that's, that's obviously one of the difficult things is that initially, the scale is not big, then the high, which prevents you from having a competitive product.

<p>What I find really exciting is our development of a range of fish alternatives. Micro algae are a fantastic source of protein, micro algae, very interesting nutrients, but also flavour. And they can have a great role in binding because of the alginates that are in there and etc, etc. So now, what I'm thinking of is using both micro algae and micro algae to create these alternative fish products. So that's, that's, you know, what I'm really excited about at the moment. And now we just need to, you know, turn that into a reality.

<p>What advice might you give to someone starting on this journey, so someone starting in the journey of entrepreneurship in this not maybe in your space, but in a similar, sustainable, sustainably focused space? I'm sure there's lots but anything that comes through.

     <br>
            
<p>For me, the most important lesson is that and this is explained the kind of the mistake I made, I was so passionate about the solution, seaweed, that I forgot to see that ultimately people have relatively primal needs, emotional needs, and you need to figure out what's, what's going on there and how, how your solution can help, you know, address needs that people already have. Because the big thing is if you're if, you know, if you want to create a new need, it's gonna take decades, and it's simply too much of a struggle. So, you know, if you want to create the need for people to eat, see me, it's too hard, if you want to create a guilt free snack, that works, because they already have the need for a guilt free snack. So if I link seaweed, in the nachos that we make, to the need for people to have a guilt free snack, to feel less guilty about what they give their kids, etc. to have a convenient, great looking side dish that we're now that's how we're positioning the CV chips in the world of service, then then you're linking something to something that already exists, and then that's more that's a flow, then that works. So the big mistake is not to do that and to think that everybody's going to be as excited about your solution. But you don't have you haven't created the link with an existing important, urgent need. So that that's I think, the biggest one and validate that to really make sure that this need exists, and that people can see how the C suite addresses that. And the best example is what I explained about the meat, you know, okay, so there's a huge need for alternative meat products that is easily validated, but you also need to validate that on a psychological level. People are Yeah, and and seaweed is a logical You know, ingredient part of this alternative meat product. So so that's that's where I think people need to be really critical that they they create something that addresses an existing need.

<p>So you’ve touched on the power of mentorship in navigating this career path but, in your opinions, what are the most common reasons for deep-tech start-ups to fail?
</p>
    
    <br>
    
          </b>
    </div>
<p> Fundraising and money are definitely key reasons. A problem with fundraising in deep-tech is time-span. You have to consider that investors are looking for a return on investment. Ten years invested in deep tech is an awfully long time and puts a lot of investors off. Then, once you have funding you can stumble by spending too much, or spending too little and not making enough progress. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>

Another reason for failing is because you don't build a strong foundation. There's a lot of things that can go wrong in business and you have to be prepared. If you’re not looking around making sure that everything you do is right, stuff can go very, very badly. It's like if you're building your house, every brick counts.

<p>On the technical side, we need to keep improving the product. For this we need to get a chemical engineer or a polymer scientist. This all means funding. So the second goal is to raise more money and find a new lab. We’ve been accepted into the Mass Challenge Accelerator in Switzerland which will help us here.

<p>I think our experience shows that you don't necessarily need a technical background to make progress in deep tech. So, if you have a passion and an interest in something you can get some seriously good work done.
Another thing is to think about fundraising early. Getting the fuel into the car is one of the hardest parts for a lot of entrepreneurs.
