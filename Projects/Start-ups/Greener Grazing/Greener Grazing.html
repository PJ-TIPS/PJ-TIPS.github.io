When I started in aquaculture, I was involved in the development of RAS technology and always integrated the fish with plants in what is now called aquaponics. At a certain point along the way,I made a major shift to look at how to scale aquaculture sustainably. This helped me realise that the marine tropics was a large opportunity that was woefully underdeveloped. So I brought Australis the barramundi company from a primarily US-RAS model to a Vietnam ocean farming model and with that transition really was looking for how can we get back to this idea of integration of seaweed? And so for some time, we've had Kappaphycus seaweed farming as an intercrop with our rotational fallowing program. So when we cultivate the fish, after one year we pick up the cages, move them to a different lease, and  come in with submerge tube nets to cultivate akappa[hycus. And that's really cool that a lot of ways - it has some local environmental benefits, It attracts a lot of fish and definitely has enhancement effects. But those benefits are really local and so when I came across the research out of James Cook, that's was promoting this great seaweed that they'd found, which seems to have a huge impact on the methane production from RUMINANTS- I called up the researchers and said, this is super cool. How are we going to get supply? And they said, we don't know, basically. So that's the origins of.

<p>What have been some of the challenges you've experience with Greener Grazing?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> Well, the interesting thing about green grazing is that it has on one side incredible interest and demand from the market. There's a really pronounced interest amongst beef and dairy producers to reduce the climate impacts of what they do. And I think they probably feel a bit under threat from the Beyond meats and Ipossible Burgers's of the world. And I think there are ways that growing cattle that probably can be pretty climate friendly except for this methane problem. So one hand is an amazing amount of demand and the other is a really big technical challenge about how we found this new species of seaweed and. There are two possible answers to that, one is you could grow it on land, in ponds or tanks using tumble culture, but we feel that that's a very expensive pathway and unlikely to provide the supply or the cost that will drive production. So we've taken the longer, harder, but hopefully much more interesting path to try and do the science that's necessary to close the life cycle in order to reproduce and produce seeded groups on land that can then be transferred to the sea, because once you get to the sea, the cost of the scalability is more economical.

 </div>
<p>At this point, Greener Grazing is a technical initiative, and to the extent that it's kind of collaborating with other people, it's largely around advancing the science, the cultivation and not so much on how we get the product in the market. How do we get the product processed into the market? So to the extent that we kind of move through the supply chain, it's more that we are talking to a lot of prospective farmers and also in some cases governments who want to promote this as the new sustainable marine industry and then ultimately make their cattle sector more climate friendly. But we're really not spending a whole heck of a lot of time on that because the technical challenges still have to be resolved around the productivity consistency of the of the process itself. 

What we're doing is we're really trying to build, in a sense, a global network of collaborators. This is a hard problem - accelerating the pace to be able to develop a novel, red seaweed with really small spores, a complex life. So to do that quickly, we think the path is to have really great people To to move quickly. </p>

<p> I mean, clearly, we're in the early days on lots of types of seaweed and being in the early days generally means that the techniques aren't as refined as they are going to need to be. seaweed is a tremendously exciting space, both for direct food production, for biofuels or carbon sequestration. There's all these ideas out there about ways that we can use it to combat climate change that are really interesting and exciting. They then depend on a lot of technologies advancing from where they are today.

     <br>
            
<p>I think there's a lot of room for people to be bold, but bold vision has to be married with technical acumen and these things, in some ways you can't you have to have this kind of balance of like you need to start and be in the game. But at the same time, you have to be investing in advancing the technology. So I think the way that it moves forward is through the advancement of knowledge. So investing in that, building partnerships, bringing the best minds together.

<p> Not so much on this narrow sector. Paul Greenberg's Four fishes is an amazing book about the oceans and how to think think about aquaculture broadly, and I think that's one of the best.
