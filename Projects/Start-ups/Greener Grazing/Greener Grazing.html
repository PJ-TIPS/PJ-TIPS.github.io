<p>What was the motivation behind creating Greener Grazing?
  </p>
      </b>
                                </div>

     <br>
<p>Speaker1: [00:00:26] I can tell you. Very well. I have a question. Now that I've enjoyed it, so I'm pretty used to it, it was. That's from. 
    
WHat was the motivation behind creating Greener Grazing?

Sure. Well, my my origins in aquaculture were really inspired by learning about the integrated approach to multi-trophic -poly culture systems, and so when I started in aquaculture, I was involved in the development of RAS technology and always integrated the fish with plants in what was called aquaponics. I was doing it before anybody had named it that. And at a certain point along the way,I made a major shift to look at how to really scale aquaculture sustainably which brought me to the idea that the marine tropics was a large opportunity that was woefully underdeveloped. So I brought Australiss the barramundi company from a primarily US-RAS model to a Vietnam ocean farming model and with that transition really was looking for how can we get back to this idea of integration of seaweed? And so for some time, we've had Kappaphycus seaweed farming as an intercrop with our rotational fallowing program. So when we cultivate the fish, after one year we pick up the cages, move them to a different lease, and  come in with submerge tube nets to cultivate akappa[hycus. And that's really cool that a lot of ways - it has some local environmental benefits, It attracts a lot of fish and definitely has enhancement effects. But those benefits are really local and so when I came across the research out of James Cook, that's was promoting this great seaweed that they'd found, which seems to have a huge impact on the methane production from RUMINANTS- I called up the researchers and said, this is super cool. How are we going to get supply? And they said, we don't know, basically. So that's the origins of. 
    
What have been some of the challenges you've experience with Greener Grazing?
    
 Well, the interesting thing about green grazing is that it has on one side incredible interest and demand from the market. There's a really pronounced interest amongst beef and dairy producers to reduce the climate impacts of what they do. And I think they probably feel a bit under threat from the Beyond meats and Ipossible Burgers's of the world. And I think there are ways that growing cattle that probably can be pretty climate friendly except for this methane problem. So one hand is an amazing amount of demand and the other is a really big technical challenge about how we found this new species of seaweed and. There are two possible answers to that, one is you could grow it on land, in ponds or tanks using tumble culture, but we feel that that's a very expensive pathway and unlikely to provide the supply or the cost that will drive production. So we've taken the longer, harder, but hopefully much more interesting path to try and do the science that's necessary to close the life cycle in order to reproduce and produce seeded groups on land that can then be transferred to the sea, because once you get to the sea, the cost of the scalability is more economical.
    

What is next for Greener Grazing?
    
At this point, Greener Grazing is a technical initiative, and to the extent that it's kind of collaborating with other people, it's largely around advancing the science, the cultivation and not so much on how we get the product in the market. How do we get the product processed into the market? So to the extent that we kind of move through the supply chain, it's more that we are talking to a lot of prospective farmers and also in some cases governments who want to promote this as the new sustainable marine industry and then ultimately make their cattle sector more climate friendly. But we're really not spending a whole heck of a lot of time on that because the technical challenges still have to be resolved around the productivity consistency of the of the process itself. 

What we're doing is we're really trying to build, in a sense, a global network of collaborators. This is a hard problem - accelerating the pace to be able to develop a novel, red seaweed with really small spores, a complex life. So to do that quickly, we think the path is to have really great people To to move quickly.
    
    
    
What's next for the seaweed industry?
 I mean, clearly, we're in the early days on lots of types of seaweed and being in the early days generally means that the techniques aren't as refined as they are going to need to be. seaweed is a tremendously exciting space, both for direct food production, for biofuels or carbon sequestration. There's all these ideas out there about ways that we can use it to combat climate change that are really interesting and exciting. They then depend on a lot of technologies advancing from where they are today.
    
What advice would you give to your younger self or a young individual trying to pursue business generation in this field?

I think there's a lot of room for people to be bold, but bold vision has to be married with technical acumen and these things, in some ways you can't you have to have this kind of balance of like you need to start and be in the game. But at the same time, you have to be investing in advancing the technology. So I think the way that it moves forward is through the advancement of knowledge. So investing in that, building partnerships, bringing the best minds together.
    

Any books you might recommend? 
Not so much on this narrow sector. Paul Greenberg's Four fishes is an amazing book about the oceans and how to think think about aquaculture broadly, and I think that's one of the best.

<p>Thibaut, how did you personally get involved in this space? </p>

 </div>
<p>Carlo had the original idea and, after a year and a half of work, decided that he needed someone with a more scientific background to join him. We are both originally from Monaco and already knew each other from there. We got back in touch when Carlo moved to London. Then, one Sunday morning he called me and said “I have this idea - it's about bioplastics and you could do the R&D.” So I joined the venture as a CTO and we’ve since made good progress with the prototype. Now with some product development, a lot of research and plenty of idea- generation, we have a patent on the prototype. </p>

<p>Could you tell me what the biggest challenges have been so far and how you’ve overcome them?</p>

         </div>
                        <br>

<p>Carlo: A few main challenges stand out. The first being my lack of any deep scientific experience. I loved the challenge of learning but, naturally, at some point I just needed more expertise. 

The second challenge was financial.  We’re bootstrapped so we have to do things locally at the moment. Despite this, we’ve managed to do really well and we’re working on fundraising. Fundraising is a challenge in itself. 
</p>
                        
                    
<p>Thibaut: On the topic of fundraising, a story my academic tutor tells me is that, if you're lucky, five percent of your time as a professor is spent in the lab and the other 95 percent is spent looking for funding. It's something you need to consider early. 
    
Another challenge is that when you leave university, you often realise that you don't know anything. In terms of developing a real technical product, you might know nothing. That was a really hard thing to accept at first.  Thinking outside the box is a skill we had to develop. If you want to do something new, you need to develop that bit of imagination.

<p>How are you guys learning on the job? Given that juggling the building and the learning is difficult at times, what strategies do you have to stay on top of things?</p>
    </b>
    </div>
     <br>
            
<p>I think the question is how do you keep learning in a methodical way. There are an infinite number of things to learn. If you tried to go in every direction, you lose your time. We needed to learn how to divide the tasks and not try to stay on top of everything. 

There are three obvious ways to learn in a start-up. Number one- keep reading. Books, articles and reports on business, science and much more. There is so much to consume and it really makes the difference. 
    
    <br>
    <br>

Number two, talk to people. It's vital. Get advisers. We're lucky enough to have an adviser with 30 years of experience in startups and scale ups. He's always pushing us to be better.
    
    <br>
    <br>

Number three, it’s not really a strategy but a reality that you're forced to learn when you're up against a stone wall. Even if you don't see the learning opportunity when you’re up against an impossible task, you will still learn something because you discover new things every time you do something. Especially in the startup, entrepreneurial life.

<p>So you’ve touched on the power of mentorship in navigating this career path but, in your opinions, what are the most common reasons for deep-tech start-ups to fail?
</p>
    
    <br>
    
          </b>
    </div>
<p> Fundraising and money are definitely key reasons. A problem with fundraising in deep-tech is time-span. You have to consider that investors are looking for a return on investment. Ten years invested in deep tech is an awfully long time and puts a lot of investors off. Then, once you have funding you can stumble by spending too much, or spending too little and not making enough progress. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>

Another reason for failing is because you don't build a strong foundation. There's a lot of things that can go wrong in business and you have to be prepared. If you’re not looking around making sure that everything you do is right, stuff can go very, very badly. It's like if you're building your house, every brick counts.

<p>On the technical side, we need to keep improving the product. For this we need to get a chemical engineer or a polymer scientist. This all means funding. So the second goal is to raise more money and find a new lab. We’ve been accepted into the Mass Challenge Accelerator in Switzerland which will help us here.

                        <br>

<p>I think our experience shows that you don't necessarily need a technical background to make progress in deep tech. So, if you have a passion and an interest in something you can get some seriously good work done.
Another thing is to think about fundraising early. Getting the fuel into the car is one of the hardest parts for a lot of entrepreneurs.
