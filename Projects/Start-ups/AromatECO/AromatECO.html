<p> AromatEco is an early-stage company operating out of London. AromatEco produces sustainable high-value flavours and fragrances using genetically engineered organisms. In this interview I spent time with Dr Patrik Jones, Jonathon Muller and Ben Ng who are the team behind this climate-tech company. Patrik is an Academic with more than 20 years of R&D experience in microbial metabolic engineering. He co-founded Arakoon Wines and BIO-F Solutions and was a great Academic Tutor and mentor during my time at Imperial College. Jonathan is a PhD student in life sciences who is leading the R&D and the development of new products as CTO. Ben completed a MEng. degree in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial and has co-founded two companies. He is leading the Market and Business development aspect as CEO.   </p>
                        <br>
                     
                        
<p>"Pete:  All right, so firstly, I just want to say thanks, guys, I really appreciate you coming today. I've been wanting to get you on board for a few months now. So let's start with Patrik. Could you tell me what the motivation behind creating this company was?
  </p>
 
<p>Patrik:  It was very much about wanting to take things further. Rather than just publishing something and then hoping that one day perhaps it would have an impact. This is another practical opportunity to carry out research outside of the academic world. We could create a company that would be very effective and could take things forward very fast outside of the academic environment, for example, just to give you a bit of context, if I come up with an idea in the academic environment, write a grant proposal and then have it funded and then actually managed to hire a person, I mean, it's at least one year away. So that's a very long time and it is a very competitive environment and if we can act much faster based on our own decisions within a company, I think this is a lot of potential there that I think I would like to be part of exploring, not necessarily being leading it, but being part of that.</p>
 
<p>Peter:  I suppose that's part of the challenge with your taking your research out of a university. They're trying their best to make it as easy as possible to spin out. But that comes with all sorts of challenges including less freedom. How do you feel that that's affected the progress that's been done around this early stage company?</p>
 
<p>Patrik: So it hasn't influenced us really that much, but I do have another spinoff where it has been a major roadblock. It's a long story but let's just say that there's substantial room for improvement. Despite this, they are definitely trying more and more to be honest. </p>
 
<p>Peter: Thanks Patrik. Ben, could you give me a quick description of the company?</p>
 
<p>Ben: So in AromatEco we are trying to sustainably produce chemicals from CO2 and other sources by using microbes. That's basically the gist of it. We take these microbes, the bacteria, cyanobacteria, an ultra photosynthetic process or a process like how you would ferment alcohol, and instead of getting alcohol, you get the chemicals that you would use in everyday manufacturing for things like flavors.</p>
 
<p>Peter: Thanks,Ben, could you give us a bit of context around how you got involved with this team?</p>
 
<p>Ben:  So I'm actually in the U.K. right now on the startup visa. I had another startup before this called Elize.io, but that one failed during the pandemic. So I had nothing to do for about three months. Then I realized at that time Johnny needed a business person to come on board to help all of the business stuff. And I was like, I'm not doing anything right now, I can't get a job myself.  I'd met up with him in the U.K. before and I'd heard about his research and it really excited me but I had Elize...So.. when I approached him the second time, I told them I'll do work for them first on probational basis and to keep both of us comfortable, and to be on the same team. And what really excited me about his startup was that the chemical industry has a sustainability problem. It can really just be turned around with the research that he has. The chemical industry can go from a carbon emitting industry to a carbon absorbing industry, with just this technology. It's the future. I like the energy industry because it has renewables and they're trying to get to net zero, and zero emisions.  The chemical industry can go further and take-IN carbon, which  is something really exciting.</p>
 
<p>Peter: Yeah, sure.  I'm curious to hear your take on this experience, Johnny, because in my experience, the culturing of cyanobacteria can really be a challenge. What are some of the challenges that you've really come up against in the engineering of these organisms?</p>
 
<p>Jonathon: I would say one of the big challenges is that they grow quite slowly so it can take about a month or so to generate some new strain and a few more weeks to culture and then actually have some data. So to get around that, I've been using E. coli like a biological prototype because I can introduce the same pathway into them and get results within a week. This means I can then iterate a few rounds within E.coli, optimize the pathway and then transfer to the same bacteria first. And that really speeds up the process.</p>
 
<p>Peter: Has it been a challenge to note significant patterns when you're dealing with such small amounts of chemical synthesis?</p>
 
<p>Jonathon: It's not too bad, actually, because we use a GCMS, nd HPLC and they're both very sensitive, you can measure products at concentrations less than a milligram per liter. And luckily, all the strains have been working with have been productive enough for the most part so that's not a problem. And then there's also other things you can do. So I kind of sometimes culture my strains with what's called a solvent overlay which extracts the product and concentrates it and then that makes it easier to analyze.</p>
 
<p>Peter: Thanks Jonny, and Ben, could you could you let me know what the biggest roadblock that you've stumbled up against as CEO of AromatEco?</p>
 
<p>Ben: So it's more to do with the chemical industry not being very transparent with what they want. So my last start-up was in the tech sector. Everything was pretty agile and quick. You can get customer research done pretty fast compared to the slow and traditional chemical industry.  One major roadblock was actually finding out which products initially to target. We had been able to do some chemicals, but they didn't really want it and they didn't tell us what they actually wanted just because there is a lot of secrecy involved. Sometimes the secrecy stems from the fact that they are trying to make that chemical themselves. There is a lot of that.</p>
 
<p>Pete: So, guys, if you were to talk to a fellow early-stage startup founder in climate-tech, do you have any tips or insights that you might be able to give which might offer an important lesson you have learned on this journey. </p> <br>

<p>Jonathon: One thing I've noticed is that when we speak to potential investors or accelerators, our tech always has a wow factor. They always want to come back and hear more, but then they kind of struggle to fully get it because it's very specialized. It can almost sound a bit magical that we're going to capture CO2 from the air and turn it into a product. So really, thinking about how you communicate your science to the public is key. An example is how I used the term biological prototype for the E.coli strain. By using that phrase, people  get it and  come on board more easily.</p>
 
<p>Ben: For me, it's perseverance and drive. That's going to sound really cliche, but that's just it. That's how you get the traction rolling. I met someone that went from a business degree to doing bioplastics all by himself during the pandemic. And he was only armed with was GCSE chemistry and tenacity.  The other thing is that it's really a numbers game. Especially in a traditional industry, it really becomes a numbers game just to keep talking to people, finding out more, get connected, and then sooner or later, the people that you initially connect with will start connecting you with the people they need to connect with. Then you can find that one champion that will just help you in the industry. That's what we're actually trying to do right now. All you need is that one champion who makes the difference for so many deep tech start ups.</p>
                        <br>
                        
    
<p>Also, make sure you network with the people relevant to you. Initially we did networking with the wrong people and they didn't seem to understand our product. Once you start approaching environmental angels and people within the space they start understanding what we were doing and doors started opening.</p>
 
<p>Pete: Patrik, did you have something to add that?</p>
 
<p>Patrik: I think Ben's observation is really good. Of course there's an element of luck, but it's not just about waiting for something to happen. You need to be out there active and networking. The more we do that collectively, the more we are likely to strike the right people and the right opportunities.</p> 
 
<p>Peter: Yeah, exactly. What's the next steps then for AromaticEco?</p>

 
<p>Jonathon: So we have a product. We're working on optimizing its biosynthesis and then after that, the next thing would be to scale-up  because right now we're just growing them in the lab space. We're actually working on setting up a mini bioreactor now to start testing that out.</p>
 
<p>Patrik: And we have a chemical engineer in a room that doesn't have any windows working away right now...</p>
 
<p>Ben: Yeah, we kind of have to get the scale-up done, but the most important next step is finding that champion and keep looking for the other chemicals that everybody else needs. We kind of have a few in mind, but we're not sure that the industry wants it yet. That would be the next step.</p>
 
<p>Patrik: I think it's also a question of what do we need to move forward? A lot of the investors are looking for sales. If you get sales, you get income. So that then kind of shifts the attention and the ball can start rolling. But until then it feels like we are still getting over this little thermodynamic hump, and, once we're over it, then things will roll from then.</p>
 
<p>Ben: So it's also about all that boring stuff at this stage, like getting all the certifications, all the legal documents done for the chemicals. So you need to prove that it's safe for transport, for logistics, and then we can get a sales contract signed.</p>
 
 
<p>Pete:  Ok, thanks, guys. That's all for today. I really appreciate you taking the  time and I'll be keeping a close eye on any developments. Thanks very much." <p/>
