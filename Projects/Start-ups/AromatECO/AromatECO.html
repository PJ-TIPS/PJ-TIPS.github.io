<p> AromatEco is an early-stage company operating out of London. AromatEco produces sustainable high-value flavours and fragrances using genetically engineered organisms. In this interview I spent time with Dr Patrik Jones, Jonathon Muller and Ben Ng who are the team behind this climate-tech company. Patrik is an Academic with more than 20 years of R&D experience in microbial metabolic engineering. He co-founded Arakoon Wines and BIO-F Solutions and was a great Academic Tutor and mentor during my time at Imperial College. Jonathan is a PhD student in life sciences who is leading the R&D and the development of new products as CTO. Ben completed a MEng. degree in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial and has co-founded two companies. He is leading the Market and Business development aspect as CEO.   </p>

<p>Could you give me a quick description of the company?</p>
 
<p> The goal is to sustainably produce chemicals from CO2 and other sources by using microbes. We take these microbes and use a photosynthetic process to create chemicals that you would use in everyday manufacturing.</p>
                        
<p>What was the motivation behind creating this company?
  </p>
 
<p>A few things. Firstly, it was an opportuntity to take things further and create a company that would be very effective outside of the academic environment. One of the main benefits is that it allows for faster decision making. Secondly, it is clear that the the chemical industry had a sustainability problem which can all change with this technology. Instead of being a carbon emitting industry the chemicals sector can become a carbon-absorbing industry which  is really exciting.</p>
 
<p>Peter: Ben, could you give us a bit of context around how you got involved with this team?</p>
 
<p>Ben:  I'm actually in the U.K. right now on the startup visa. I had another startup before this called Elize.io, but that one failed during the pandemic. I realised that Johnny needed a business person to come on board to help all of the business stuff. So I approached Johnny and Patrik and here we are. what really excited me about his startup was that the chemical industry has a sustainability problem. It can really just be turned around with the research that he has. The chemical industry can go from a carbon emitting industry to a carbon absorbing industry, with just this technology. It's the future. I like the energy industry because it has renewables and they're trying to get to net zero, and zero emisions.  The chemical industry can go further and take-IN carbon, which  is something really exciting.</p>
 
<p>What are some of the technical challenges that you've really come up against and how have you got around these?</p>
 
<p>One of the big challenges is that our organisms grow quite slowly. It can take about a month or so to generate new strains and a few more weeks to culture and collect data. So to get around that, we've been using E. coli like a 'biological prototype' because we can introduce the same changes to these and get results within a week. This means we can then iterate a few rounds within E.coli, optimize the pathway and then transfer it to our bacteria. This has really sped up the process.</p>
 
<p>What ar some of the business challenges you've come up against?</p>
 
<p>It's mainly to do with the chemical industry not being very transparent. This is quite unlike other tech like SaaS where you can get customer research done pretty fast compared to the slow and traditional industries.  One major roadblock was actually finding out which products initially to targetand there is plenty of secrecy around what products are being produced already.</p>
 
<p>Could you give any tips or insights which might be helpful for a fellow early-stage startup founder in climate-tech?</p> <br>

<p>Thinking about how you communicate your science is key. Sometimes investors will struggle to understand the highly specialized terminology you use. An example is how we have started to use the term 'biological prototype' for the E.coli strain. This alone has helped bring people on board.
In addition, you need perseverance and drive. That's how you get traction, especially in a traditional industry where it really becomes a numbers game. You need to keep talking to people and sooner or later, people will start connecting you with the people you need to connect with. Then you can find that one champion who will help you in the industry. You need to be out there active and networking. The more we do that collectively, the more we are likely to strike the right people and the right opportunities. That's what we're actually trying to do right now. 
Also, make sure you network with the people relevant to you. Initially we did networking with the wrong people and they didn't seem to understand our product. Once you start approaching environmental angels and people within the space doors start opening.</p>

 
<p>What's the next steps for AromaticEco?</p>

 
<p>The next thing is our scale-up. We're actually working on setting up a mini bioreactor now. In addition, we need to find that industry champion to help us, and, look for other chemicals that the industry is after right now. After that, investors are looking for sales. If you get sales, you get income and the ball can start rolling. But until then it feels like we are still getting over this little thermodynamic hump, and, once we're over it, then things will roll from then.
