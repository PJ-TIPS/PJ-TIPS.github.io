<p>What was the motivation behind creating Arctic Seaweed?

     <br>
<p>I always wanted to do something different and build something from nothing. So, four or five years ago, I met another young entrepreneur and together we realised some of the opportunities available in seaweed. We worked on developing some concepts into industrial systems and that's how we got started. It has been really motivating to do something meaningful.

<p>Where do you see the industry going in the next 10 years?</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> From a producer point of view, we are approaching the catch up effect as demand is increasing. The continued growing interest from the consumer is very positive and is motivating companies to reach out to suppliers.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    The challenge so far has been volumes in Europe.  We don't produce enough volume to be considered a serious contender in business to business, fast-moving consumer goods. 
    

    <br>
    <br>
    
    I think we are getting close to the mark where the demand is going to increase significantly. As a sustainable, locally sourced ingredient, seaweed is a great product. However, we are not completely there yet. For example, there is still a lot of waste. So we need to continue to find ways to reduce all the industry footprint. This will come with time because the product is completely sustainable. After all, we only use sunlight for the product.   </p>

<p> How do you monitor the quality of your seaweed and who would you send that to?  </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
<p>You have the technical quality, which is the composition of the plant. This means that you send a plant or a sample for analysis to look for the different component- good and bad like heavy metals. We also send samples for microbiology analysis to document that we don't have any pathogens. Then you have less quantifiable metrics like visual, colour etc. Finally we have to harvest our seaweed before it is found with external organisms like bryozoans and other grazers.   </p>

<p>Expansion. our plan is to go to 1000 tonnes by 2024 and then try to double that by 2030.

<p>What advice would you give to someone interested in building companies in this area? </p>
    </b>
    </div>
     <br>
            
<p>Make sure you continually have enough funding for the long term. It is going to take more time and more money than you think. Therefore, make sure you are in it for the long run. You need patience.
