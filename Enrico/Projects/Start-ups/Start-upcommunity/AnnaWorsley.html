<p>My role coming into the company was formulation scientist or senior scientist. Put very simply, I'll get a drug and mix it into different materials to create a cartridge or filament for 3D printing. Then, the team has to test the product to make sure that the drug is still active after 3D printing. Despite being a scientist, since coming into the company I've been involved in many other roles due to the nature of working in a start-up.

<p> I was quite keen on working somewhere where you get more involved in company creation. As I mentioned, I've currently got multiple roles in the start-up and I really love that.

    It was great. I managed to use it to fund a continuation of my PhD project. I organized another animal trial for the project with my old team and now we are waiting back for the results. </p>

<p>Since then you spent some time at Notpla- a bioplastic company using seaweed as a raw material. What's your perspective on this industry? </p>
    </b>
    </div>
     <br>
            
<p>There's no doubt that seaweed is a useful material which will create useful products. There are more and more projects in this space which is exciting. On the other hand, in my experience there are a lot of projects which are driven more by hype than utility. We have to be wary of that. 
    
<br> 
    <br>
    
    For companies like Notpla there is a lot of potential upside. Biodegradability policies created by the EU have created a competitive advantage for some start-ups like Notpla. It shows the role regulation has to play in these early stages of an industry.

                        <br>

<p>One challenge is fundraising. Regulation is another. It can be such a minefield. Of course regulation is extremely important but sometimes it can be difficult to navigate.
